  abstract = {This report explores improved methods for characterising consequences in the context of biosecurity decision support. It reviews current approaches used to prioritize biosecurity resources, focusing especially on the criteria used to characterise consequence and the way in which they are combined. {\textbackslash}par Six limitations are identified in current decision support protocols: 1. Vague formulation of the decision problem 2. Vague use of language 3. Poor estimation of likelihood in the prediction of expected consequences 4. Confusing means and ends objectives 5. Assigning arbitrary value judgments (or avoiding value judgments altogether) 6. Reluctance to include uncertainty {\textbackslash}par A prototype framework that seeks to address these limitations is outlined. The framework is built on theories of subjective expected utility and multi-attribute value, providing a structured means for coherently combining subjective predictions of cause-and-effect elicited from experts and the value judgments of decision-makers. It accommodates the market and non-market impacts of pest invasion. It has the potential to provide operational meaning to the concept of ‘risk return’ across the biosecurity continuum. The framework comprises five essential steps: Step 1 Define the decision frame Step 2 Define objectives and performance measures Step 3 Develop alternatives Step 4 Estimate consequences Step 5 Evaluate trade-offs and select an alternative {\textbackslash}par The report illustrates conceptual application of the framework in three biosecurity settings: (a) prioritising pests; (b) assessing the merit of alternative actions; and (c) conducting pest risk assessments under international rules governing trade.},

  abstract = {The Emergency Plant Pest Response Deed is a legally binding agreement between plant industries and government that specifies cost-sharing arrangements in the event of a pest incursion. The core principle underpinning cost-sharing is that beneficiaries of the eradication of an emergency plant pest pay an appropriate and equitable proportion of the costs of mounting a response. Stakeholders hold different views on what might be considered ‘appropriate and equitable’. The Pest Categorisation Questionnaire is a decision-support protocol that informs cost-sharing arrangements. This report critiques the Pest Categorisation Questionnaire, highlighting weaknesses and potential remedies. {\textbackslash}par There are three main problems embedded in the current protocol: 1. The protocol is ambiguous in its interpretation of the cost-sharing principle of the EPPRD. Some elements imply a cost-sharing arrangement whereby government pays according to the magnitude of impact on public values, irrespective of the magnitude of impact on private values. 2. The point scoring procedure underpinning the protocol can lead to clearly erroneous categorisation. 3. The verbal descriptors of impact (‘major’, ‘moderate’ and ‘minor’) are poorly defined, leading to assessments that confound predictions of impact with value judgments of the importance of those impacts. {\textbackslash}par Collectively, these problems lead to inconsistent categorisations. {\textbackslash}par We propose four improvements to the Pest Categorisation Questionnaire to remedy these problems: 1. Amend the decision tree for pest categorisation. 2. Clearly align each question to either public impacts or private impacts. 3. Clarify the IF-THEN rules that define cost-sharing categories. 4. Clarify what is meant by verbal descriptors of impact, and assign points accordingly. {\textbackslash}par Negotiation among key stakeholders is required to calibrate what is meant by ‘major’, ‘moderate’ and ‘minor’ impacts for public and private interests. Calibration will provide clarity on the extent to which public and private beneficiaries of eradication are required to pay.},

  abstract = {The application of decision support tools is an emerging field in biosecurity management. The goal of this report is to compare two well-known decision frameworks - cost benefit analysis (CBA) and multi-criteria analysis (MCA) - to support biosecurity decision-making. {\textbackslash}par Sharing common conceptual roots, the ultimate reason for applying both frameworks is to maximise net benefit or utility in decision-making. While CBA aims to achieve economic efficiency, MCA’s primary concern is effectiveness. Such differences triggered a debate over CBA and MCA in the 1960s. However, over time the “either…or” debate has been replaced by a more constructive discussion of a complementary nature. Therefore, instead of arguing, “Which framework is more universally preferred,” we attempted to answer the questions of “When is it better to use CBA or MCA” and “How can the two frameworks be jointly applied and mutually enhanced in biosecurity management?” {\textbackslash}par We form a list of potential factors that will influence the choice and procedural details of CBA and MCA from a literature review. We then identify ten factors that are most relevant to biosecurity management. These factors include, urgency of the decision problem, whether the invasive species and/or its management effort has any non-market impact, whether there are well-defined pre-existing biosecurity management options, level of scientific uncertainty, availability of non-market valuation studies, funding, technical capacity, stakeholders’ interest, degree of public agreement, and political mandate . {\textbackslash}par Among these factors, we believe ‘political mandate’ will favour the choice of CBA, and ‘(low degree) of public agreement’ and ‘(high level) of scientific uncertainty’ can nudge decisionmakers in the direction of MCA. The remaining seven factors will only have an effect on the specific procedures of biosecurity decision-making after either CBA or MCA is chosen. {\textbackslash}par Most importantly, we develop a conceptual framework to combine the features of both CBA and MCA in their “pure” form to create a win-win situation for biosecurity management. In essence, this framework integrates the ‘breadth’ and representativeness of CBA and the ‘depth’ in analysis and deliberation of MCA. We demonstrate how to apply this framework with two decision trees and one case study. One tree features CBA as the dominant tool, complemented by four elements of MCA, while, in the other, MCA is the main decision-aid and is complemented by three CBA components. The case study integrates choice modelling and MCA and offers an innovative decision-making model for biosecurity management by combining the CBA feature of broader representativeness and the MCA characteristic of open and in-depth group process.},

  abstract = {The National Environmental Biosecurity Response Agreement (NEBRA) establishes the national cost-sharing arrangements between the Commonwealth, States and Territories for responding to significant pest and disease incursions, including in the marine context. When an incursion is of national significance, potentially eligible for cost sharing under NEBRA, and likely to be eradicable, the notifying party responsible for the original notification must supply additional information to assist with decision-making. A benefit-cost analysis (BCA) is one of these key pieces of information. {\textbackslash}par Development of the initial BCA must be undertaken relatively quickly and ideally by staff with experience in developing BCAs. A particularly difficult aspect of BCA development is identifying and valuing the ‘non-market’ impacts of the pest on marine environments. In the time-critical context of responding to a marine pest incursion it can be difficult to find (or reallocate) in-house staff with skills in developing BCAs in general, or for marine pest incursions in particular. Some jurisdictions outsource BCA development to consultants experienced in BCA. However, resources may not be available to outsource development of the BCA in all cases. {\textbackslash}par This report provides guidance to staff within jurisdictions – economists and noneconomists – on preparing a BCA for a marine pest incursion. A set of notated guidelines takes staff through the steps required in a BCA and detailed advice is provided in a series of appendices. The guidelines are based on those provided by the Office of Best Practice Regulation, and are consistent with requirements of the NEBRA. They are also intended to improve consistency in BCA development. While only responses that aim at eradication are considered for cost-sharing under the NEBRA1 , the guidelines in this project would be equally applicable to BCA developed for other management options.},

  abstract = {Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has been identified as the single greatest disease threat to Australia’s livestock industries. Vaccination is increasingly being recognised as an important tool to assist in containing and eradicating FMD outbreaks. The two options for vaccinated animals at the end of an outbreak are to remove them from the population in order to expedite regaining FMD-free status (‘vaccinate-and-remove’), or to keep the animals in the population and allow them to live out their normal commercial lives (‘vaccinate-and-retain’). More than 90\% of the economic costs of an FMD outbreak in Australia would arise from revenue losses caused by immediate and prolonged export bans by Australia’s FMD sensitive markets. Following an outbreak of FMD, surveillance will be required to demonstrate that infection has been eradicated from the population in order to meet international requirements to regain FMD-free status and to satisfy trading partners so as to regain access to international markets. Although there is growing interest in vaccinate-and-retain policy for the control of FMD to avoid the need for large scale culling of at-risk animals, keeping vaccinated animals in the population will make achieving recognition of free status more difficult under current international rules. {\textbackslash}par From a policy perspective it would be very useful if disease managers had access to decision support tools that could be used to evaluate policies and approaches to regain FMD-free status and facilitate early return to trade. This project expanded the functionality of the Australian Animal Disease model (AADIS) currently being used by animal health authorities in Australia to support FMD planning and preparedness, to include capacity to evaluate different approaches to post-outbreak surveillance in previously infected areas and a module for post-outbreak management of vaccinated animals. {\textbackslash}par To demonstrate how the improved functionality can be used, case studies of hypothetical outbreaks in Qld, WA and Vic. are reported. These studies involved comparing different approaches to disease control and post-outbreak management. In the first study, vaccination used with stamping out provided no improvement over stamping out on its own in the Qld case study scenario, provided a small but significant improvement in the WA case study and was highly effective in reducing the size and duration of the outbreak in the Vic. case study. This finding highlights that when it comes to considering the use of vaccination, a ‘one size fits all’ approach is not appropriate. {\textbackslash}par In the second demonstration study we showed how a reduced sampling intensity surveillance approach used with a control program not involving vaccination, could significantly reduce the number of samples collected and the cost of the post-outbreak surveillance program without increasing the risk of missing residual infected herds when compared to a baseline surveillance based on the European Union FMD Directive. However, when emergency vaccination is used, there was a high likelihood that some vaccinated herds will be exposed to infection and under a vaccinateand-retain policy, post-outbreak surveillance programs, even when census sampling is used, cannot be guaranteed to find all of these herds. ‘There is a risk that some animals in vaccinated herds that were exposed to FMD virus could have been infected and some of these could be carriers. Recovered animals that are not carriers do not pose a risk of transmitting FMD. Carriers are considered a potential but unquantified risk for spread of FMD. After a comprehensive surveillance program the risk of carriers remaining in the population is low but not zero.’ {\textbackslash}par The third demonstration study compared (a) vaccinate-and-retain; (b) vaccinate-and-remove (slaughter to waste) and (c) vaccinate-and-remove (slaughter and salvage) policies for managing vaccinated animals. The vaccinate-and-remove strategies were associated with higher post-outbreak management costs but lower loss of trade costs. In terms of overall cost, there would be significant savings compared to the vaccinate-and-retain policy. From a cost point of view there was no advantage of removal with salvage compared to removal to waste under the study assumptions. Any savings made through salvage are offset by trade losses associated with longer time required to remove all vaccinated animals, and regain markets. {\textbackslash}par This project has developed and demonstrated modelling functionality to support policy development around important issues to facilitate regaining FMD free status and regaining market access after an FMD outbreak. However, the limited nature of the studies and uncertainty around some parameters means that more work is required before it is possible to provide clear advice and guidelines to disease managers. It is anticipated that the work done in this project will continue under a MLACSIRO FMD project funded under the Rural R\&D for Profit Program.},

The approaches described include case-based approaches, disability adjusted life years (DALYs), quality adjusted life years (QALYs), cost of illness studies (COI), willingness to pay (WTP), and integrated quantitative/semi-quantitative approaches. The report finds that DALYs are most useful as measures of population health burden of disease and QALYs as measures of the effectiveness of interventions. DALYs should be used for making comparisons between and among zoonotic and nonzoonotic diseases. Conversion of measures to dollars could be useful whenever budgetary decisions are determined by monetary costs and when such inputs are required for cost–benefit analyses. {\textbackslash}par If a wider set of consequences is considered, the review recommends cost of illness (COI) studies. The report suggests that a bottom–up approach is more suitable for measuring monetary burden of illness due to zoonotic diseases. The willingness-to-pay (WTP) approach may be warranted if ‘intangible’ costs are important. Structured decision methods provide a means for partitioning the scientific assessment of the total cost or burden of disease, from the social choices that emerge in setting priorities.},

  abstract = {This report summarises the three papers that are the main outputs of this project. {\textbackslash}par These papers examine the uncertainty associated with measures of vegetation condition on patches of remnant vegetation and on sites managed as offsets for clearing or other vegetation modification. In particular the papers focus on the BioMetric and Habitat Hectares measures of site quality, developed for use in New South Wales and Victoria respectively, and on the Cumberland Plain Woodland vegetation type. The papers find that uncertainty regarding current and expected future vegetation quality is a significant issue for investment planning. Inaccurate measures can lead to declines in biodiversity value and reduce the cost effectiveness of investments in vegetation restoration. Improving the accuracy of the measures and making planning processes more robust to failures of restoration actions to enhance biodiversity outcomes are important implications. There appears to be less scope for improving the precision of the measures and this is likely to be costly. A useful extension of the work would be to undertake a spatially explicit landscape scale analysis although this would require landscape scale measures of vegetation quality. The software developed for specifying the uncertainty and calculating robust offset ratios are additional project outputs.},

The potential for these methods to serve effectively in a biosecurity setting is evaluated. {\textbackslash}par The most appropriate tools and methods for characterising the impacts of invasive pests and diseases are identified from the sets available. Their strengths and weaknesses are discussed, and examples are provided of their applications. {\textbackslash}par The report develops specific approaches for assessing primary production, social and environmental impacts and describes them in detail. The methods include: A partial equilibrium economic model coupled to a simple biological spread model applicable to a broad range of pests and diseases; The use of constructed scales to encapsulate a range of social, cultural and amenity values; The use of the probability of extinction as an appropriate measure of impact on biodiversity. Given the difficulty of estimating this aspect directly, a method is outlined for estimating an impact metric that may be applied to a broad range of native and culturally important species, and which provides a proxy measure of the probability of extinction. {\textbackslash}par The report also discusses situations where a broader general equilibrium analytical framework is appropriate and outlines what this approach would involve. It explores how the shapes of consequence curves can affect investment decisions, particularly in the longer term. {\textbackslash}par Due to the difficulty in servicing traditional economic impact simulation models with sufficient and accurate data, we suggest the need for a broader range of criteria on which to base biosecurity investment decisions. In particular, we advocate the use of quantitative models of prediction in conjunction with structured decision‐making techniques so that the full extent of market and non‐ market invasion consequences can be appreciated by decision makers.},

  abstract = {This is a review of a range of current risk assessment protocols for live organisms, condensed into an overriding set of themes. The themes, extracted from protocols, are evaluated using qualitative and quantitative data to elucidate the ranking of pest species on the basis of their invasive ability in Australia and are generally confined to assessing a single taxon. Five overall themes are fundamental to the majority of protocols: pathways of entry; establishment; potential distribution; impact in environmental, economic and social systems; and feasibility of management (including surveillance, detection and control). {\textbackslash}par The themes separated into two areas: the first being the probability and potential of the species to invade and spread in Australia; and, the second being the impact on the environment, economy or social systems. Pathways, establishment, potential distribution and feasibility of control can be effectively analysed using a Bayesian network approach. A generic framework for such an analysis was prepared and is included in this report. The impact of an invasive pest is best assessed using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). MCDA provides the opportunity to examine conflicting interests and objectives. The underlying trade-offs can be examined and the impact of alternate choices can be quantified in the final rankings. A set of parameters and measurement techniques for an MCDA, ranking the importance of invasive non-primary industry pests is proposed in this report. {\textbackslash}par A subset of the Weeds of National Significance list was used to assess the robustness of rankings within a single MCDA methodology. Different MCDA methodologies were examined using 11 different pests selected from the Northern Australia Quarantine Strategy pest lists. These pests were selected from different taxons to examine the feasibility of applying the MCDA framework across different taxa.

  abstract = {This report looks at two important dimensions to the characterization of consequences in the context of biosecurity decision-support. {\textbackslash}par Part A explores time preference. Pests vary in the time over which their impacts are realized. Likewise, stakeholders vary in the time horizons they consider relevant to biosecurity concerns. Agricultural impacts might reasonably be considered over 30 years. Ecologists typically consider environmental impacts over much longer time frames. Part A addresses: The conceptual relevance of time preference to biosecurity using monetary benefits and costs associated with the decision of whether or not to invest in preventing invasion of a weed. How time preference has been approached in case studies reported in the literature, focussing on contrasts between decision support approaches based on conventional benefit-cost analyses versus those that use a multi-attribute approach. The literature highlights the failure of multi-criteria approaches to address time preference. An empirical study that elicited time preferences from biosecurity experts and managers for market and non-market-impacts. Problems in dealing with time preference using multi-attribute decision support and a remedy based on normative understanding of weights and their role in articulating trade-offs. {\textbackslash}par Part B demonstrates the relevance of the economic concept of ‗value of information‘(VOI), and how biosecurity managers can use VOI analysis to decide whether or not to reduce uncertainty by collecting additional information through monitoring, experimentation, or some other form of research. It explores: How some uncertainties may be scientifically interesting to resolve, but ultimately irrelevant to decision-making. VOI analysis provides a rigorous way of assessing the benefits of collecting additional information, and determining whether reducing uncertainty will result in a better decision. A prototype model where a manager must choose between eradication or containment of an infestation. Eradication is more cost-effective for smaller infestations, but once the extent reaches a certain size it becomes more cost-effective to contain. When choosing between eradication and containment, how much does knowing the extent of the infestation more exactly improve the outcome of the decision? We calculate the expected value of perfect information (EVPI) about the extent, which provides an upper limit for the value of reducing uncertainty. We then illustrate the approach using the example of red imported fire ant management in south-east Queensland. We calculate the EVPI for three different uncertain variables: the extent of the infestation, the sensitivity (true positive rate) of remote sensing, and the efficacy of baiting. This case study is an illustration only, although with further work it could be developed into a useful support tool. Future avenues for research in this area include modelling the time delay associated with research and monitoring, and applying more complex VOI calculations such as the expected value of partial information and the expected value of sample information.},

A modelling study was carried out to identify characteristics measurable during the early phase of a FMD outbreak that might be useful as predictors of the total number of infected places, outbreak duration and the total area under control. {\textbackslash}par The study involved two modelling platforms in two countries (Australia and New Zealand) and encompassed a large number of incursion scenarios. Linear regression, classification and regression tree and boosted regression tree analyses were used to quantify the predictive value of a set of parameters on three outcome variables of interest: the total number of infected places, outbreak duration and the total area under control. The number of infected premises, number of pending culls, area under control, estimated dissemination ratio, and cattle density around the index herd at days 7, 14 and 21 following first detection were associated with each of the outcome variables. Regression models for the size of the area under control had the highest predictive value (R2 = 0.51 - 0.9) followed by the number of infected premises (R2 = 0.3 - 0.75) and outbreak duration (R2 = 0.28 - 0.57). Predictability improved at later time points in the outbreak. Predictive regression models using various cut-points at day 14 to define small and large outbreaks had positive predictive values of 0.85 - 0.98 and negative predictive values of 0.52 - 0.91, with 79\% to 97\% of outbreaks correctly classified. On the strict assumption that each of the simulation models used in this study provide a realistic indication of the spread of FMD in animal populations we conclude that relatively simple metrics available early in a control program can be used to indicate the likely magnitude of an FMD outbreak under Australian and New Zealand conditions.},

The report represents the outcomes of the first phase of a multi-year project designed to develop a rigorous method that can be used repeatedly to evaluate the health of the national biosecurity system against agreed performance criteria using appropriate performance indicators. The report was prepared for the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources (the department) but has relevance to all participants in the national biosecurity system. {\textbackslash}par The department currently relies largely on qualitative pathway-specific risk analyses and reviews to assess and address potentially unacceptable exposures to biosecurity risk. These analyses and reviews focus mainly on elements of the biosecurity system for which the Australian government has responsibility. However, the department does not currently have a means of estimating the health of the national biosecurity system as a whole against appropriate performance criteria This is a significant business gap that limits the capacity of the department to evaluate the effectiveness of its investments across the biosecurity system. Other participants, such as state and territory governments, are equally constrained in assessing the role they play in meeting the objectives of the overarching biosecurity system. {\textbackslash}par The report summarises progress to date on the project. It uses a program logic model to describe the key elements of the national biosecurity system, including the activities undertaken in the system by different participants, the resources to support them, the outputs that are produced by these activities and the outcomes they generate. The report also identifies the broad attributes of health against which the biosecurity system will be evaluated. These recognise that the national biosecurity system should be capable of meeting its objectives in an effective, efficient, robust, resilient and sustainable manner. {\textbackslash}par A case study is used in the report to measure aspects of biosecurity health against the framework. The case study is focused on some activities in the biosecurity system that are designed to prevent biosecurity risk material from entering the country on the air passenger pathway. The case study provides insights into the challenges and opportunities that will arise from the measurement of national biosecurity system health. It also explores the accessibility of data necessary to underpin effective performance evaluation and identifies gaps in current data availability. {\textbackslash}par The capacity to articulate the health of the national biosecurity system in clear terms against appropriate criteria provides a sound basis on which all participants can identify where system improvements can be made, either individually or on a collective, system-wide basis.},

  abstract = {1. The Australian Government Department of Agriculture and Water Resources has invested in the development of a disease simulation modelling capability, the Australian Animal Disease (AADIS) model, to support disease preparedness and response (Bradhurst et al. 2015). While AADIS was initially developed to simulate outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease there are a range of other disease threats it could be used for, including vector (insect) borne diseases. The aim of this project is to enhance AADIS to allow it to simulate the spread (and control) of vector-borne diseases of livestock such as bluetongue which is spread by Culicoides brevitarsis. {\textbackslash}par 2. This project combines a one-year CEBRA project with a three-year PhD research programme. The first year of the project, including the CEBRA component, focussed on development of: (a) the facility to import data from an external source into AADIS to represent vector abundance; and (b) the facility allowing users to estimate insect vector abundance directly within AADIS. Our intention here was to provide decision makers with flexibility. Simulation of vector distribution dynamics within AADIS will allow deployment of models to assist rapid decision making at the national level. Provision of a facility that permits the importation of spatial grids developed using third party statistical tools allows subject matter experts to develop (and then deploy) their own vector distribution models better suited to support decision making at finer spatial scales. A hypothetical vector with similar characteristics to C. brevitarsis was used as a case study for the AADIS vector module development. {\textbackslash}par 3. The C. brevitarsis distribution estimates developed external to AADIS were based on the published work of Kelso \& Milne (2014) with estimates of long distance dispersal of midges simulated using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model (Stein et al. 2015). {\textbackslash}par 4. The prototype AADIS vector module used the existing AADIS grid to represent the distribution of the hypothetical culicoides vector and a logistic growth equation to represent within-cell vector population dynamics. Jump and diffusion pathways were defined based on existing pathways in the AADIS agent-based model. The AADIS vector module was calibrated using data from the National Arbovirus Monitoring Programme. {\textbackslash}par 5. The following remaining tasks will be completed during the three year PhD programme: (a) verify and validate the AADIS vector module as a means for estimating insect vector abundance; (b) verify and validate the Kelso \& Milne (2014) HYSPLIT C. brevitarsis modelling approach described in this report; (c) provide guidelines for those developing vector abundance maps external to AADIS on how to numerically express vector abundance so that it is in a format suitable for use by AADIS; and (d) develop appropriate program logic to allow an infectious agent to spread within the vector population and to allow transfer of infection from the vector population to a livestock population at risk.},

  abstract = {Biosecurity agencies face challenging decisions of how best to allocate scare resources when they attempt to prevent, detect, eradicate and suppress exotic and established pests and diseases. In this regard, there is a key di↵erence between the value of biosecurity measures and the extra value, or value-added, of investments in biosecurity. The overall question, in other words, is not how valuable a given biosecurity measure (or set of measures) is, but how to allocate resources across di↵erent biosecurity measures and threats to get the best possible rate of return. {\textbackslash}par While resource allocation in biosecurity may be approached as a standard portfolio problem (Akter et al., 2015), allocating resources to address biosecurity threats may pose three additional challenges. First, policy makers are often faced with a (possibly large) number of pests, and each can be associated with a range of biosecurity measures, namely pre-border, border quarantine, post-border surveillance, and containment and eradication. A measure to control or prevent a particular pest likely influences the effectiveness of other measures, and the overall costeffectiveness of the money spent to address this problem. Consequently, a biosecurity portfolio must allocate a budget not only across di↵erent pests, but also across di↵erent measures to detect and control them. Second, invasive species are diverse in terms of how they spread, how they cause damage and how they are controlled, so evaluating cost-effectiveness across measures and species, as well as making them comparable, is complicated. Finally, apart from the biological and ecological stochasticity inherent in invasive species that can influence the outcome (Perrings 2005), a biosecurity portfolio must often be decided at early stages where information about many of the characteristics of the threats are very rough and scant. For this reason, biosecurity portfolio models ideally should not be overly demanding in the information required to calibrate them. {\textbackslash}par A proper portfolio allocation in biosecurity di↵ers from the common principle which ranks alternative projects by their benefit-cost ratios (Pearce et al., 2006) and picks the one that generates the highest benefit-to-cost ratio (BCR). This principle is sometimes referred to as ‘the winner takes all’ principle because the projects with highest average BCRs will be allocated at full scale while others may have no budget. This often results, however, in a misallocation of resources because the average BCR of a biosecurity project can be highly sensitive to its scale. Instead, it’s best to allocate each (small) block of budget to the treatment and measure that it is most cost-effective, and consequently determine the optimal scale of the control program for each threat with di↵erent levels of budget constraints. The cost-effectiveness of each block of budget spent on a threat is determined by minimising its expected total cost, including the damages it inflicts and the control expenditures incurred in preventing or mitigating damages. In this way, rates of return from a given biosecurity measure are maximised. BCRs can be positive at di↵erent scales, in other words, but the key is to find the largest di↵erence between benefits and costs. {\textbackslash}par This report, for CEBRA Project 1608A, illustrates these points, in terms of: (a) the optimal trade-o↵ between border and post-border biosecurity expenditures, and (b) the optimal level of post-border ‘early detection’ of an exotic pest. The case we examine is papaya fruit fly (PFF) through the Torres Strait pathway, although the principles apply broadly. The border is taken as trapping (and other) activity in the Torres Straight Islands (TSI) and post-border is defined by a surveillance measure in northern Queensland. {\textbackslash}par In terms of (a), allocations between border and post-border surveillance depend on a host of complicated issues, and a set of parameters that drive a computational outcome. That said, the idea is simple: we need to find a set of measures, at the border and post-border, that maximise rates of returns by minimising the sum of all potential damages and the cost of the biosecurity measures themselves. This is equivalent to finding an allocation that ensures that the extra benefits of combined biosecurity measures, border and post-border, in terms of all the avoided losses that go with these measures, exactly equal the extra costs of providing the measures themselves. {\textbackslash}par In this part of the report the key parameters are average arrival rates, spread rates, eradications costs, the discount rate, and the effectiveness of quarantine and surveillance measures. Using these (and other) baseline parameter values we can calculate optimal border quarantine and post-border surveillance measures. The results from the PFF case determine an overall optimal expenditure or portfolio allocation at a ratio of 1:5 for border and post-border measures. Given parameter values, in other words, and although both activities are valuable, it pays to invest more in post-border surveillance than at the border. Sensitivity results outline the range of possibilities given changes in parameter values. {\textbackslash}par In terms of (b), allocating resources for post-border surveillance, taken separately, given border quarantine measures, also generates an issue of value versus value-added or what the best rate of return should be. For a trapping network for the ‘early detection’ of fruit flies, for example, the question is, put simply, how early to detect a possible incursion in order to maximize the probability of eradication. A trapping grid that is very ‘tight’, with many traps placed in host-suitable areas will detect very early, but then the cost of the program itself, with a large number of traps, is very expensive. Having less traps means the cost of the surveillance program is lower, but then detection will be later and thus potential avoided losses will be higher. In total, if the extra benefits of adding more traps exceed the extra costs, that investment should take place, and continue to take place until extra benefits exactly equal extra costs. {\textbackslash}par In this part of the report, which modifies and extends material contained in CEBRA Project Report 1405C, Baseline ‘Consequence Measures’ for Australia from the Torres Strait Islands Pathway to Queensland: Papaya Fruit Fly, Citrus Canker and Rabies, we illustrate how to determine an optimal point of early detection. The parameter set is further complicated with control costs, production losses, the costs of trapping, and the probability of a given fruit fly to find a nearby host, among other things. Results indicate an optimal grid size of less than 1km, much less than current practice. As expected, a grid size that is much smaller than this implies that the cost of the program is too large relative to the extra benefits (in terms of the smaller avoided losses that go with early detection). A grid size that is larger than 1km generates relatively large and (otherwise) potentially avoided losses. The best grid size is illustrated by the minimum of all losses and expenditures. This maximises the rate of return from the surveillance activity. Model runs and sensitivity analysis further elaborate the role of border versus post-border biosecurity measures in terms of changes in the ‘arrival rate’ and its effect on expenditures. {\textbackslash}par Recommendations 1. Both the basic and the more complex spatial model in this report perform well, and clearly illustrate tradeo↵s between border and post-border expenditures on biosecurity. This forms a basis for discussions of resource allocation across various biosecurity measures, and should be further developed or refined going forward. 2. Although data and estimations are available for most of what is needed, the model framework likely requires a more careful calibration of parameter values, especially in cases where model results are most sensitive to changes in these values, and where measures of ‘effectiveness’ of border and post-border activities are needed. 3. Pre-border expenditures could be added to the model framework, in principle, given needed data and estimates of underlying parameter values. This should be pursued going forward to allow for best ‘portfolio allocations’ of biosecurity expenditures across the entire spectrum of biosecurity measures.},

  abstract = {Invasive species are a major threat to ecosystems worldwide. Once invasive species have established, even with a determined commitment to control, contain or eradicate an invasive species, it is often difficult to decide on the most efficient and effective management strategy due to the complex interaction of factors such as the extent of the invasion, the ecology of the species, the dynamics of the system, and how the species responds to different management actions. Invasive species by their very nature disperse through a system at a rapid rate, indeed their spread and persistence is often driven by a spatial network of infestations in the landscape. If spatial processes are ignored in our decisionmaking process we may allocate time and money managing individual infestations while key areas driving the spread of the species are inefficiently controlled. Under such a scenario attaining our goals of eradicating or controlling spread of an invasive species may not be attained, having dire consequences for environments we are trying to protect. {\textbackslash}par Prioritising the management of invasive species across the landscape to maximise our chance of eradicating an invasive species can be modelled as a Markov decision processes (MDP) and solved using stochastic dynamic programming methods. Managing invasive species spatially is a challenging theoretical problem due to Bellman‟s curse of dimensionality: the computational complexity grows exponentially with the number of parcels in the system. Another practical issue arises with classic SDP method; the solution proposed only present one optimal strategy amongst a set of possible alternatives constraining decision managers to one option. Using networks as a spatial representation of our optimisation problem we overcome these drawbacks using structured MDP and algebraic decision diagrams (ADD) representations. By doing so we take advantage of the structured colonisation processes between parcels and provide for the first time the set of all optimal strategies to manage invasive species on a network. Under general assumptions we derive rules of thumb for some key network structures. {\textbackslash}par Using MDP assumes we can observe the system perfectly and determine which parcel is infected or not. In reality we often do not have access to this information. Partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model tackles the problem of deciding the most appropriate management action given the difficulty of detecting invasive species. Work by Regan et al (in review) has looked into the optimal management of an invasive weed branched broomrape (Orobanche ramosa) under imperfect detection addressing the key issue of management at a single parcel level. Here, we account for the spatial components of the system and how spatial considerations may affect optimal management of a cryptic invasive species. Using structured POMDP and network representation, we investigate the role space plays in optimally managing invasive species and produce the first spatially explicit decision support tool for managing cryptic invasive species. We provide general rules of thumb that can be applied to a range of species in diverse situations.},

  abstract = {Australia operates one of the most comprehensive biosecurity systems in the world. However, due to the system’s size and complexity, it is unclear exactly how much monetary 'value' it generates and where that value is generated within the system. Without a clear understanding of the net benefits obtained from the existing investment in biosecurity activities it is difficult to determine the extent to which the system is achieving its desired objectives (its ‘health’) and also whether there is scope to increase either the value or health of the system by altering the allocation of resources. {\textbackslash}par Past attempts to value the biosecurity system have been based on ad-hoc and/or qualitative statements of overall benefits or limited to specific major pests or diseases, such as an estimate of the consequences of an incursion of foot and mouth disease in Australia. Consequently, where estimates of value do exist, they have typically been calculated using different measures of value; inconsistent or incomplete monetisation of impacts; incompatible assumptions or counterfactuals; and/or over different temporal or spatial scales. To the best of our knowledge, no equivalent economic evaluation of an entire biosecurity system, or at least a major part of the system, has ever been successfully completed. {\textbackslash}par Given the scale of the task of estimating value at the system level, a staged approach is required. The first phase of CEBRA project 1607A delivered a comprehensive review of the biosecurity economics literature, and identified suitable methods, measures and indicators of the types of value generated by biosecurity interventions. The purpose of this report is to develop that review into a framework for estimating the value of Australia’s biosecurity system through a multi-year project. {\textbackslash}par We begin by explicitly defining the set of participants, their activities and outputs that collectively comprise Australia’s biosecurity system. Then, following the generic framework of Boardman et al. (2011), we propose a specific combination of approaches for estimating the value of that system based on its unique characteristics (rather than some theoretical ideal). Throughout the report we draw on a number of case studies to highlight several important issues, or their solutions, that have been identified by the project team over the first twelve months. {\textbackslash}par In total, we provide seventeen recommendations (see over) that collectively outline a measured and pragmatic approach for estimating the value of Australia’s biosecurity system. Wherever possible, we recommend leveraging the existing tools employed by the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources (DAWR) and the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES), augmenting these methods only where necessary to improve accuracy or defensibility (such as accounting for changes in consumer surplus). Importantly, we also propose limiting the scope in several respects (such as the breadth of impacts considered), to help keep the valuation tractable in its first iteration. {\textbackslash}par Finally, although the recommendations that comprise our framework are not novel or controversial from an economic evaluation standpoint, we are not aware of any existing analysis of an Australian biosecurity program that has fully implemented this approach. Consequently, we also recommend that this approach be used as a standardised template for conducting any future evaluations of Australian biosecurity interventions, including those outside the scope of our project, so that their results can be more readily incorporated into any future estimates of the system’s value.},

The report evaluates the “sensitivity” of results to the choice to performance scales. It concludes that it is possible to change the final ranking of options just by recalibrating the scoring scales for the criteria. {\textbackslash}par This arbitrariness is not a feature or a fault of the MCDA model. It is a misuse of the weighted average decision method. To address the issue, the report recommends that analysts ensure that the weights for numerical criteria reflect the relative importance of the criteria, and that they are conditioned on the way in which the performance-scoring scales for the criteria are calibrated.},
