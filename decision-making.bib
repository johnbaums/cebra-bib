  abstract = {This report explores improved methods for characterising consequences in the context of biosecurity decision support. It reviews current approaches used to prioritize biosecurity resources, focusing especially on the criteria used to characterise consequence and the way in which they are combined. {\textbackslash}par Six limitations are identified in current decision support protocols: 1. Vague formulation of the decision problem 2. Vague use of language 3. Poor estimation of likelihood in the prediction of expected consequences 4. Confusing means and ends objectives 5. Assigning arbitrary value judgments (or avoiding value judgments altogether) 6. Reluctance to include uncertainty {\textbackslash}par A prototype framework that seeks to address these limitations is outlined. The framework is built on theories of subjective expected utility and multi-attribute value, providing a structured means for coherently combining subjective predictions of cause-and-effect elicited from experts and the value judgments of decision-makers. It accommodates the market and non-market impacts of pest invasion. It has the potential to provide operational meaning to the concept of ‘risk return’ across the biosecurity continuum. The framework comprises five essential steps: Step 1 Define the decision frame Step 2 Define objectives and performance measures Step 3 Develop alternatives Step 4 Estimate consequences Step 5 Evaluate trade-offs and select an alternative {\textbackslash}par The report illustrates conceptual application of the framework in three biosecurity settings: (a) prioritising pests; (b) assessing the merit of alternative actions; and (c) conducting pest risk assessments under international rules governing trade.},

  abstract = {The Emergency Plant Pest Response Deed is a legally binding agreement between plant industries and government that specifies cost-sharing arrangements in the event of a pest incursion. The core principle underpinning cost-sharing is that beneficiaries of the eradication of an emergency plant pest pay an appropriate and equitable proportion of the costs of mounting a response. Stakeholders hold different views on what might be considered ‘appropriate and equitable’. The Pest Categorisation Questionnaire is a decision-support protocol that informs cost-sharing arrangements. This report critiques the Pest Categorisation Questionnaire, highlighting weaknesses and potential remedies. {\textbackslash}par There are three main problems embedded in the current protocol: 1. The protocol is ambiguous in its interpretation of the cost-sharing principle of the EPPRD. Some elements imply a cost-sharing arrangement whereby government pays according to the magnitude of impact on public values, irrespective of the magnitude of impact on private values. 2. The point scoring procedure underpinning the protocol can lead to clearly erroneous categorisation. 3. The verbal descriptors of impact (‘major’, ‘moderate’ and ‘minor’) are poorly defined, leading to assessments that confound predictions of impact with value judgments of the importance of those impacts. {\textbackslash}par Collectively, these problems lead to inconsistent categorisations. {\textbackslash}par We propose four improvements to the Pest Categorisation Questionnaire to remedy these problems: 1. Amend the decision tree for pest categorisation. 2. Clearly align each question to either public impacts or private impacts. 3. Clarify the IF-THEN rules that define cost-sharing categories. 4. Clarify what is meant by verbal descriptors of impact, and assign points accordingly. {\textbackslash}par Negotiation among key stakeholders is required to calibrate what is meant by ‘major’, ‘moderate’ and ‘minor’ impacts for public and private interests. Calibration will provide clarity on the extent to which public and private beneficiaries of eradication are required to pay.},
