  abstract = {As approved by the Biosecurity Research Steering Committee, the aims of this project are to 1. identify software that can meet NZ MPI’s requirements for monitoring international trade in biosecurity-regulated goods, including the ability to detect breaches of the biosecurity system, and 2. investigate the experiences of other jurisdictions in managing biosecurity risk from e-commerce. {\textbackslash}par Of the biosecurity agencies successfully contacted only USDA–APHIS has an existing program of automated e-commerce monitoring. The monitoring service they use is provided on contract by a third party. The Great Lakes Commission has been concurrently using and refining its software to monitor e-commerce of invasive species into the Laurentian Great Lakes region. The Australian Department of Agriculture \& Water Resources has a manual monitoring program, which is augmented by intelligence received from a non-profit organisation, the Invasive Species Council. {\textbackslash}par The systems that most closely meet the software requirements advised by NZ MPI, or whose available descriptions suggest they may, are 1. IBIS Replacement — an as yet unnamed system that can perform fully customisable searches of the internet, potentially including e-commerce monitoring 2. GLDIATR — the system developed by the Great Lakes Commission to monitor e-commerce in its member jurisdictions 3. iTrade — a system in the early stages of development by the University of Kent for detecting probable sales of illegal wildlife items; and 4. ETH Zurich’s unnamed system developed for researching e-commerce trade in invasive plants. {\textbackslash}par In selecting a system for use, or in developing an entirely new system, the following factors — beyond normal software procurement practice — should be considered: 1. the technical and legal issues with scraping data from websites 2. the inability to obtain details of persons who actually purchase goods online 3. the need to invest in developing and maintaining effective query parameters; and 4. if automated text processing techniques are used, the need to invest in the development and maintenance of effective algorithms and any associated ontologies. {\textbackslash}par Finally, there are several opportunities for collaboration on the further development of automated e-commerce surveillance capability, notably with organisations and researchers active in biosecurity and wildlife trade regulation and advocacy.},

  abstract = {This report documents stages 1, 2, 4, and 5 of ACERA Project 1003 as well as initial progress on stage 7. The report assesses online systems for biosecurity intelligence–gathering and analysis against DAFF’s intelligence needs (stage 2), which were evaluated in a workshop on 14/08/2009 (stage 1). The report also assesses existing online animal biosecurity intelligence systems (stage 4) and plant biosecurity intelligence options (stage 5). Work on stage 5 lead to the development of a prototype plant health intelligence system, thus making initial progress on stage 7. It also lead to the development of a more sophisticated prototype intelligence system for marine pests and diseases. The main findings of this report are: 1. The reviewed biosecurity intelligence systems do not satisfy DAFF’s intelligence needs. There is virtually no coverage of plant pests and diseases, and the same is true for marine/aquatic pests and diseases. Although animal pests and diseases are better covered, the reviewed systems still fail to satisfy DAFF’s biosecurity intelligence needs. 2. DAFF staff are crippled by current IT restrictions. The situation is so dire that in order to complete various stages of this research project, ACERA had to supply some members of DAFF with laptops with independent and unrestricted internet connections. These laptops have since proven to be indispensable to staff conducting modern biosecurity intelligence gathering and analysis. 3. There is a significant amount of important information pertaining to biosecurity intelligence in new online media such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, podcasts, and RSS feeds. DAFF staff are currently unable to access this information. Similarly, a wealth of information exists in scholarly journals, forums, discussion boards, and webinars. For various reasons, DAFF staff are unable to access this information and this is seriously affecting their ability to acquire and analyse biosecurity intelligence. 4. There is a huge opportunity for DAFF to be an international leader in modern biosecurity intelligence, especially for plant and marine/aquatic pests and diseases. Initial progress has already been made in developing a sophisticated marine and aquatic biosecurity intelligence system. This work was done during stage 5 of this project in collaboration with Dr Geoff Grossel from the Aquatic Division of Animal Biosecurity in the BSG. One early version of this system (developed by Dr Grossel) has already lead to a concrete decision that mitigated a serious biosecurity risk: oyster or ostreid herpesvirus (OsHV–1 or OsHV–1 µvar) entering Australia. The system gave early warning of the disease spreading through Europe, and the probability of it spreading to Australia through the importation of used oyster farming equipment. Based on this information, it was decided that all such equipment should be decontaminated before leaving quarantine. New Zealand was not in a position to make this decision, and the virus has now spread to New Zealand oyster farms. {\textbackslash}par Biosecurity information now exists in many forms on the internet. In the past, such information was mostly contained in news articles, which users would have to access directly or through a search engine (e.g., Google). However, RSS feeds have gained widespread use on the internet, and now articles from news media sites can be delivered to users as soon as they are published online. This means that biosecurity information can be brought to users as soon as it is published on the web. {\textbackslash}par This stream of information can be automatically collected, sorted, translated, and enriched. For example, an article in Spanish with the symptom terms ‘apatia’ (apathy), ‘deshidratación’ (dehydration), ‘náusea’ (nausea), and location term ‘Peru’ can be automatically detected in a newspaper’s RSS feed and classified as likely to be about a cholera outbreak in Peru—even though the term ‘cholera’ is not in the original article. This enriched report can be published to a number of other RSS feeds, which can be tailored to the interests of health officials. One such RSS feed could be devoted to all articles on potential cholera outbreaks. Another could be for all articles on any public health issue in Peru. There is no limit to how RSS feeds can be filtered and recombined in this way. {\textbackslash}par Since the establishment of RSS feeds on the web, new types of feeds have emerged. Geo–RSS and KML feeds allow articles to be tagged with latitude and longitude co–ordinates. This means that information can be streamed to mapping systems (such as Google Maps and Google Earth) that allow information to be plotted on a map. Instead of a simple list of articles on potential cholera outbreaks around the world, a health official can view a map in which those articles are plotted. This allows the official to achieve so–called ‘situational awareness” (i.e., to see potential clusters of reports, or other pattens in the data). This map can be updated automatically as new articles are published. {\textbackslash}par Automated systems will always produce errors. A system may ascribe a collection of symptoms to be indicative of cholera, when in fact those symptoms are more likely to be caused by some other disease. GPHIN and WDIN are two systems that use dedicated experts to review their reports in order to reduce such errors. In contrast, ProMED is completely expert based (it has no automation). At the other extreme, BioCaster is completely automated, not relying on any (direct) input from experts. An approach that is between these two extremes—partly taken by HealthMap—is to allow users to make contributions to the system with commentary, rankings of relevance, etc. This approach is sometimes called a ‘Web 2.0’ approach as it takes advantage of the knowledge that can be generated by large numbers of users interacting through a software system. (Wikipedia, for example, is a Web 2.0 application.) This sort of approach has the advantage of making use of human analysis for free. {\textbackslash}par A similar approach is taken by EpiSPIDER, which collects information from Twitter. By watching Twitter for biosecurity–related search terms, EpiSPIDER gathers articles that have been read and perhaps even categorised by users. Moreover, this can be done without the users knowing it. Someone travelling in Thailand could tweet a webpage on, say, a concert being cancelled, which also pertains to biosecurity—e.g., the concert is cancelled due to organisers fear of a dengue outbreak. This may be the only source of information on this issue, and it can be detected by EpiSPIDER, even though no one consciously reported the webpage for this purpose. {\textbackslash}par Since such user input and feedback can reduce errors and increase the number of reliable sources, some biosecurity intelligence systems appear to be moving to use social media. There are important questions concerning the reliability of social media compared with standard news media. Such issues are studied in social epistemology (e.g., on the reliability of blogs versus news media, see Goldman [2008]). Probabilistic models from the literature on judgement aggregation and consensus formation have been also studied with respect to potential biosecurity applications (see ACERA Project 607). More research in formal methods of social epistemology (with a focus on applications to biosecurity intelligence) needs to be conducted as biosecurity intelligence systems move to social media. {\textbackslash}par The report confirms that the available software systems do not adequately meet DAFF’s needs— particularly in the domains of plant, marine, and aquatic pests and diseases. None of the systems give substantial attention to plant and marine biosecurity—indeed, they give very little to no coverage. Although human, animal and zoonotic diseases are better covered, focus tends to be on diseases that attract significant coverage in the news media (e.g., H1N1). As part of stage 7, two prototype systems were developed for plant and marine biosecurity. Initial results from the prototypes suggest that further investigation and development of plant and marine biosecurity intelligence systems would be of significant advantage to DAFF. It is highly recommended that these prototypes be further developed and supported. The development of these prototypes should be guided by a study of the pros and cons of existing biosecurity intelligence systems as well as research in social epistemology. It is crucial that the prototypes remain open–source and unhindered by DAFF’s IT restrictions. It would also be of considerable advantage to DAFF if there were systems that covered less well–reported animal diseases, and acquired intelligence from a greater range of conventional sources (e.g., scientific journals) as well as less conventional sources (e.g., social media). More detailed recommendations for how to further develop the prototypes are given in Section 9.1. {\textbackslash}par The marine prototype system analysed information from Twitter and it was noticed that topics that received a lot of attention on Twitter were typically already known or not of interest to DAFF. This suggests that Twitter could be used to filter out topics which DAFF staff do not need intelligence on, thus allowing them to focus on issues important to them. It was also noticed that Twitter was the first or sole source of information on some events which were potentially important to DAFF. Moreover, it was discovered that there are informal networks of people sharing biosecurity information within Twitter.1 {\textbackslash}par Many of the systems reviewed in this report are biosecurity intelligence systems that are web– based and open–source. Enterprise search systems, which in contrast are closed–source, have not been reviewed in this report. However, it is likely that the implementation of an enterprise search system, such as MS FAST or ISYS, would be of great benefit to DAFF, since such a system would allow information to be shared within DAFF in an intelligent way. It should be noted, though, that an enterprise search system does not perform the same functions that open–source web– based systems perform. Although enterprise search systems can search the internet for biosecurity information in more–or–less the same fashion as open–source web–based systems do, the results of such searches are not open–source and are accessible only to those who have access to the enterprise search system. Systems such as ProMED clearly demonstrate that there is great value in allowing the global community to view the results, since users of the system can contribute back into the system, by confirming/disconfirming initial reports, submitting new information missed by the system, etc. {\textbackslash}par These two types of systems are not in conflict, and in fact complement each other. An enterprise search system can be used to organise and share information within DAFF that may be of a sensitive nature and not to be shared with the rest of the world. A web–based open–source system can be used by DAFF staff to interact with experts in the global community to acquire intelligence that would otherwise not be able to be obtained. This intelligence can then be fed into the enterprise search system to add to the quality of that information. Implementation of both types of systems would probably best serve DAFF’s biosecurity intelligence needs. {\textbackslash}par Access to the diverse and new sources of biosecurity intelligence is crucial to meet many of DAFF’s biosecurity intelligence needs. Currently, DAFF staff are unable to access these sources due to content bans and IT restrictions. Access is needed to RSS and KML feeds; podcasts; webinars (online seminars); blogs; Twitter; online video and audio content; YouTube; Wikis (including Wikipedia); as well as journals, discussion boards, and online forums.},
