  abstract = {Risk Communication is crucial for the risk analysis cycle, and may be dramatically improved by clear prose. Clear prose—and therefore clearer presentation of evidence—may facilitate consensus over risk analyses and help avoid unnecessary debate exacerbated by unintended interpretations of information. {\textbackslash}par This aim of this project is to first test the effectiveness of various strategies for teaching Plain English, and then implement evidence-based workshops. {\textbackslash}par In this document we report on progress in developing these evidencebased workshops.},

  abstract = {The aim of the report was to review and evaluate methods for stakeholder mapping. The report intended to explore applications in biosecurity risk management, and to recommend potentially fruitful direction for testing methods that might improve the efficiency of stakeholder interactions. {\textbackslash}par The report reviews a range of options and outlines in detail the definition and identification of stakeholders, and procedures for mapping influence and interest. It uses a workshop run by ACERA on volume of trade to illustrate the basic features of these methods. The report concludes by discussing the merits and weaknesses of the mapping approaches. It recommends their use to improve the efficiency of interactions and to improve transparency of process.},

  abstract = {The aim of this project was to review literature on improving the communication of probability information, focusing primarily on medical decision aids because they were known to use graphical presentations and are presented regularly to lay people who have to make difficult decisions. Recommendations for presenting probabilities in nongraphical ways were also examined from diverse domains. {\textbackslash}par Examples from the New Zealand Apples Import Risk Analysis procedure were used to demonstrate how tools could be used in future IRAs. Recommendations included: Using natural frequency information; Using natural frequencies together with basic graphical features; Providing a “key” and/or visual representation of what a probability word is intended to mean at several points in the document; Developing probability interpretation tools which could be used at stakeholder workshops, or as a general resource independent of IRAs; Identifying “key” probability values that could be shown graphically. {\textbackslash}par The report provides examples and makes suggestions regarding how these communication tools might be tested effectively.},

  abstract = {This report presents the findings of a field-based study on biosecurity risk communication in the Yass region. The study tested the usefulness of a „mental models‟ approach to support communication strategies for the management of pests and diseases in this area. {\textbackslash}par The study found that the size of landholdings was not an important factor associated with knowledge and behaviour about biosecurity issues. Between 80 and 100\% of people were aware of the main vectors and pathways for both weeds and animal diseases. Similarly high percentages of respondents employ appropriate risk management practices. There were lower levels of awareness of animal diseases than of weeds. The term „biosecurity‟ was not widely understood. {\textbackslash}par The study‟s findings, based on the „mental models‟ approach, suggested that a biosecurity communication strategy for the region should be developed and delivered on a landscape scale, be directed to all landholders, and appeal to the drivers that the landholders themselves identified, specifically with respect to weed control – good land management, being a good neighbour and cost management. It should use trusted, influential agencies and use existing local networks to disseminate information.},
