  abstract = {This report addresses several of the priorities identified during the first phase of this project relating to uncertainty in weed risk management systems by John Virtue (South Australian Dept. of Land, Water \& Conservation). In particular, it assesses the effect of uncertain knowledge on our ability to identify invasive plants using classification systems. The Australian Weed Risk Assessment (WRA) system uses information on a species' current weed status in other parts of the world, climate and environmental preferences, and biological attributes to predict whether it would be a serious weed (i.e. invasive) if introduced to Australia. Documented evidence of invasiveness elsewhere is considered the best predictor of being a weed in Australia, though such evidence is not always available or is uncertain. This report assesses how critical it is to know whether a species is invasive elsewhere when undertaking a weed risk assessment, and the implications when such information is unknown or uncertain. The results show that when knowledge of invasiveness elsewhere is unknown, the probability of being invasive is generally reduced. This suggests that there is indeed some information to assist with weed classification when a species' invasiveness elsewhere is unknown. The report also helps to quantify how much opportunity in terms of residence time would be considered sufficient for a species to demonstrate invasive potential. The report estimates that based on past introductions in temperate climes (e.g. woody perennials introduced to Brandenburg [Germany] and South Australia), at least a century of observation would be required before a woody perennial species could be declared incapable of becoming a major weed with any certainty. This time could probably be reduced substantially by experimental trials that fast-track the naturalisation process. Using the original data used to "train" the WRA system, though excluding information on documented invasiveness for a species introduced outside their native range, a classification model was built that performed well in identifying weeds, though poorly at identifying non-weeds. This contrasts somewhat with the previous belief that much of the classification ability of the current WRA system arises from information pertaining to a species' introduction record and invasive status elsewhere. The report identifies some challenges in assembling the data needed to reassess the current and proposed WRA systems.},

  abstract = {We report on the provision and uptake of analysis and advice for the design and implementation of a due diligence compliance assessment system in relation to the due diligence requirements under the Illegal Logging Prohibition Act 2012 and the Illegal Logging Prohibition Regulation 2012 (Regulation). {\textbackslash}par This report recommends a stratified sampling strategy of the regulated community. {\textbackslash}par The other outputs of the project are a collection of tables and statistics that have been used by the Department to guide the design and implementation of a sampling strategy for assessing client compliance to Australia’s Illegal Logging Prohibition legislation. Briefly, the outputs were as follows, using data extracted from Customs’ Integrated Cargo System (ICS) from years 2011 and 2012: 1) a count of active importers by business size (assumed to be proportional to the value of imports), country, and product category (based on regulated tariff groups); 2) a cut-off to distinguish between small and large volume importers; 3) a count of one-off importers by year to assess mobility; 4) a time series analysis of regulated imports by year; 5) advice about selecting clients for reporting (specifically considering equal probability sampling or variable probability sampling); 6) an analysis of importer activity from countries that have Country-Specific Guidelines (CSGs); and 7) a list of the top 500 importers based on volume of trade.},
