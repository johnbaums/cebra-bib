	abstract = {The aim of this project was to develop and evaluate methods to improve the prediction of species in geographic space. For some applications such as climate change and invasive species, these methods must be used to make predictions outside the ranges of the data used to build the models, making validation even more important. New methods have arisen in statistics and machine learning to deal with these issues. {\textbackslash}par This study uses simulated data to compare the performance of modeling methods. It concludes that some of new machine learning methods, in particular, boosted regression trees and maximum entropy methods, outperform statistical and climate matching methods under a number of performance measures, for a wide range of data types, data qualities and prediction circumstances. More importantly, the paper provides advice on how a user might evaluate the performance of predictive models, to make best use of the alternatives available to them for specific purposes. {\textbackslash}par This paper provides details of how to access software and statistical code to implement several of the better behaved and most promising methods.},

	abstract = {This report summarises Phase 2 of Post-border surveillance techniques: review, synthesis and deployment in which aspects of general surveillance were investigated. This type of surveillance relies on members of the public, industry groups, plant or animal health professionals and their networks, and/or laboratories reporting suspected cases of plant or animal disease or the presence of a pest at their discretion. The research consisted of a review of new technologies for rapid, field-based (point-of-care) testing in the detection of emergency animal diseases and three case studies: 1. The first case study assessed the requirements for Australiaâ€™s ongoing surveillance for detection of ruminant diseases by (i) identifying and ranking factors that most influence the probability of early detection of various significant diseases of ruminants; and (ii) outlining surveillance programs that provide options for the early detection of diseases for different levels of confidence. 2. The second case study assessed the value of wildlife surveillance data gathered through zoo-based veterinary hospitals in Australia through (i) a one-year trial to integrate zoo-based wildlife health information reporting formally into the national surveillance system; and (ii) an analysis of the data obtained. 3. The third case study investigated the value of engaging the community in biosecurity surveillance. It reviewed the utility of data provided by the community in existing pest or disease eradication programs. This case study aimed to provide guiding principles on measuring (i) the likelihood that particular members of the community will detect a new or emerging pest or disease; and (ii) the reliability of reports submitted by particular members of the community.},

The review highlighted the set of tools that could be used to achieve or maintain market access. Most were used for â€˜proof of freedomâ€™ claims and were classified as relating to either survey design or to scenario-tree modelling, however, not all of these have been developed into readily applicable tools that could be easily and accurately applied by biosecurity managers with limited prior knowledge of the methodology. In this document we have detailed three survey design tools that have been developed from accepted statistical formulae and are well accepted in animal-disease surveillance: FreeCalc; EpiTools; and Survey Toolbox. We recommend that EpiTools be chosen for undertaking survey design and analysis. {\textbackslash}textbackslashpar After additional investigation into scenario tree modeling (including Bayesian Belief Networks) and associated generic software, the authors deem that this method requires too much prior knowledge and is not sufficiently clear that biosecurity managers or scientific staff could be reasonably expected to use and master it quickly. It appears unlikely that a tool will ever be developed that can effectively replace the amount of training that would be required to master scenariotree modeling. If scenario-tree modeling were required to make a proof-of-freedom claim, then it would be advisable to employ an expert who has had training in the use of this methodology, to undertake the analysis.},

	url = {https://cebra.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0007/2220289/1101DOID1FR.pdf},
	abstract = {Background: DAFF has adopted a risk-based approach to managing the biosecurity risk of various pathways, including international passengers and mail. During Increased Quarantine Intervention (IQI), introduced in 2001, inspection effectiveness had been used as the primary indicator of inspectorate performance. A risk-based approach to management requires a richer suite of indicators that will better align with DAFF values. ACERA Project 1001i Performance Indicators recommended post-intervention compliance (PIC) of the pathway as a performance indicator. {\textbackslash}par Overview: This project focuses on broadening the scope of the indicators, implementing them for the international passengers pathway, and assessing the effect on prioritization of passenger cohorts for further intervention. {\textbackslash}par Outcomes: â€“ The recommended indicators are: âˆ— Before intervention compliance (BIC), âˆ— Post-intervention compliance (PIC), âˆ— Non-compliance effectiveness (NCE), and âˆ— Hit rate (HR). These indicators are simple and robust measures of performance, accounting for compliance and inspectorate performance before and after arrival. â€“ Three of the indicators can be computed with existing data collections, namely BIC, PIC and NCE. HR can be computed for some sub-pathways, but better tracking information is needed, that is, information about all the intervention steps that the passengers have followed. â€“ The data prior to June 2012 were not sufficiently detailed. Collection categories have been amended to enable calculation of all indicators at the desired granularity. â€“ No substantial implications are anticipated for the profiling methodology as a result of adopting these performance measures. With profiling, the categories with the highest approach rate are targeted. The approach remains the same under the new performance measures. â€“ The performance measures can be used to produce new standard reports for monitoring performance. These reports are control chartsâ€”as used for statistical process controlâ€”but are tailored to DAFFâ€™s operational environment. Importantly, they include confidence intervals to show the uncertainty in each performance indicator. Examples are provided in Chapter 6. {\textbackslash}par Recommendations: â€“ The reported performance indicators should be used to assess how appropriately and how well the inspectorate performs, with PIC as the key indicator (p 23). â€“ Profiles for international passengers and mail articles should still be based on the approach rate (p 24). â€“ Performance indicators should be reported with confidence intervals wherever possible, to enable accurate assessment of the quality of the available information (p 14). â€“ The nominal coverage of the confidence intervals should be no less than 90\% (p 14). â€“ DAFF should determine what would be the effect upon the statistical qualities of the performance indicators of using a sampling approach to counting Incoming Passenger Cards (IPCs) instead of counting all of them (p 21). â€“ DAFF should undertake a further study to determine when and how to cluster small cohorts, and what is the effect upon profiling of that clustering, and what other optionsâ€”for example, empirical Bayes estimatesâ€”might be available for handling small cohorts (p 22). â€“ DAFF should consider whether the cutoff for high-risk cohorts should be the mean approach rate or some higher confidence interval (or, before-intervention compliance, BIC, or lower interval). The mean is the best indicator of compliance, but the higher confidence interval acknowledges that ignorance is a source of risk (p 32). â€“ Leakage surveys need to be representative in order to reduce uncertainty about the compliance of individual cohorts. DAFF should investigate how to assess and report the representativeness of the leakage survey (p 33). â€“ DAFF should review the choice of performance indicators and the data collection procedures within one year (p 23).},

	abstract = {This report explores improved methods for characterising consequences in the context of biosecurity decision support. It reviews current approaches used to prioritize biosecurity resources, focusing especially on the criteria used to characterise consequence and the way in which they are combined. {\textbackslash}par Six limitations are identified in current decision support protocols: 1. Vague formulation of the decision problem 2. Vague use of language 3. Poor estimation of likelihood in the prediction of expected consequences 4. Confusing means and ends objectives 5. Assigning arbitrary value judgments (or avoiding value judgments altogether) 6. Reluctance to include uncertainty {\textbackslash}par A prototype framework that seeks to address these limitations is outlined. The framework is built on theories of subjective expected utility and multi-attribute value, providing a structured means for coherently combining subjective predictions of cause-and-effect elicited from experts and the value judgments of decision-makers. It accommodates the market and non-market impacts of pest invasion. It has the potential to provide operational meaning to the concept of â€˜risk returnâ€™ across the biosecurity continuum. The framework comprises five essential steps: Step 1 Define the decision frame Step 2 Define objectives and performance measures Step 3 Develop alternatives Step 4 Estimate consequences Step 5 Evaluate trade-offs and select an alternative {\textbackslash}par The report illustrates conceptual application of the framework in three biosecurity settings: (a) prioritising pests; (b) assessing the merit of alternative actions; and (c) conducting pest risk assessments under international rules governing trade.},

	abstract = {The Emergency Plant Pest Response Deed is a legally binding agreement between plant industries and government that specifies cost-sharing arrangements in the event of a pest incursion. The core principle underpinning cost-sharing is that beneficiaries of the eradication of an emergency plant pest pay an appropriate and equitable proportion of the costs of mounting a response. Stakeholders hold different views on what might be considered â€˜appropriate and equitableâ€™. The Pest Categorisation Questionnaire is a decision-support protocol that informs cost-sharing arrangements. This report critiques the Pest Categorisation Questionnaire, highlighting weaknesses and potential remedies. {\textbackslash}par There are three main problems embedded in the current protocol: 1. The protocol is ambiguous in its interpretation of the cost-sharing principle of the EPPRD. Some elements imply a cost-sharing arrangement whereby government pays according to the magnitude of impact on public values, irrespective of the magnitude of impact on private values. 2. The point scoring procedure underpinning the protocol can lead to clearly erroneous categorisation. 3. The verbal descriptors of impact (â€˜majorâ€™, â€˜moderateâ€™ and â€˜minorâ€™) are poorly defined, leading to assessments that confound predictions of impact with value judgments of the importance of those impacts. {\textbackslash}par Collectively, these problems lead to inconsistent categorisations. {\textbackslash}par We propose four improvements to the Pest Categorisation Questionnaire to remedy these problems: 1. Amend the decision tree for pest categorisation. 2. Clearly align each question to either public impacts or private impacts. 3. Clarify the IF-THEN rules that define cost-sharing categories. 4. Clarify what is meant by verbal descriptors of impact, and assign points accordingly. {\textbackslash}par Negotiation among key stakeholders is required to calibrate what is meant by â€˜majorâ€™, â€˜moderateâ€™ and â€˜minorâ€™ impacts for public and private interests. Calibration will provide clarity on the extent to which public and private beneficiaries of eradication are required to pay.},

This development is important because it simplifies some recent advances in scenario tree techniques that are being used increasingly, especially in animal disease management, to substantiate claims of disease freedom. Scenario trees are a new and popular method by which surveillance systems can be evaluated. One of their limitations is that for relatively complicated systems, such as surveillance systems for animal diseases that use multiple sources of information, the scenario trees can become large and complex. This report demonstrates how to simplify large scenario trees by â€˜pruningâ€™ redundant branches. It also shows that in many situations, scenario trees can be presented as Bayesian networks, thereby taking advantage of a considerable body of knowledge, software and expertise for building and testing systems that support claims of disease freedom.},

Once identified, contaminated pathways can be mitigated. Using inspection history to analyse intercepted biosecurity risk is an important process in ensuring that inspection regimes and resourcing match a commodityâ€™s risk profile and pathway failure rate. {\textbackslash}par This project, by the Australian Centre for Excellence in Risk Analysis (ACERA) and Plant Quarantine staff, reviewed the riskâ€“return potential of imported-plant product pathways to optimize the allocation of Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF) inspection resources. Specifically, our goal was to find a way to reduce the amount of inspection without unduly increasing the leakage, defined as the amount of quarantine contamination that passes undetected. This report summarizes the results of a statistical risk analysis of inspection data for plant-product pathways. {\textbackslash}par The target of risk return for imported-plant product pathways is to implement reduced monitoring rates for identified low-risk pathways while still maintaining an acceptably low level of risk of new quarantine incursions, and to allocate the ensuing resources to managing high-risk pathways. Of the 10 pathways examined, 7 were found to be low risk. The resources used to sample these at the border can be partially reallocated to pathways of greater risk. Overall, compliant suppliers will be rewarded and risky pathways will be more adequately addressed. {\textbackslash}par The project team used an evidence-based risk approach, as recommended by Beale et al. (2008), to determine high and low risk based on the inspection failure rate and end use of each pathway.

We conservatively estimate the whole pathway level leakage following the adoption of Phase 1, as defined in this report, to be 0.42\%. (a) This estimate assumes that inspections are 100\% effective. (b) This estimate is conservative. A better supported estimate is 0.33\%. (c) The estimated whole-pathway rate of contamination that is of biological concern is 0.22\%. (d) The estimate ignores any leakage that corresponds to previously uninspected portions of the pathways (e.g., Bunkers and ship-to-ship transfers). This omission results from inability to distinguish such records in VMS. (e) The estimate is lower than 0.62\%, which was projected by Robinson et al. (2009). The alteration is due to using more data and an improved computation algorithm. (f) This estimate should be compared with 0.17\%, which is the average leakage that was effectively mandated under Increased Quarantine Intervention (IQI)1 . It is more than two times higher than the previously-mandated leakage. (g) We estimate the leakage within the pathways that fall under Phase 1 to be 1.69\%. Leakage that is of biological concern is estimated as 1.11\%. {\textbackslash}par 3. We conservatively predict that the whole pathway level leakage following the adoption of Phase 2, as defined in this report, in addition to Phase 1 will be 0.61\%. (a) This estimate assumes that inspections are 100\% effective. (b) This estimate is conservative. A better supported estimate is 0.47\%.

Leakage that is of biological concern is estimated as 0.35\%. {\textbackslash}par 4. The increase in risk that results from a reduction in intervention in the routine first-port inspection pathway should be offset by a concomitant increase in intervention in a riskier pathway. Examples of such opportunities include ballast water, biofouling, and validation inspections. {\textbackslash}par 5.
