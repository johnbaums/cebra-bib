  abstract = {This report summarises Phase 2 of Post-border surveillance techniques: review, synthesis and deployment in which aspects of general surveillance were investigated. This type of surveillance relies on members of the public, industry groups, plant or animal health professionals and their networks, and/or laboratories reporting suspected cases of plant or animal disease or the presence of a pest at their discretion. The research consisted of a review of new technologies for rapid, field-based (point-of-care) testing in the detection of emergency animal diseases and three case studies: 1. The first case study assessed the requirements for Australia’s ongoing surveillance for detection of ruminant diseases by (i) identifying and ranking factors that most influence the probability of early detection of various significant diseases of ruminants; and (ii) outlining surveillance programs that provide options for the early detection of diseases for different levels of confidence. 2. The second case study assessed the value of wildlife surveillance data gathered through zoo-based veterinary hospitals in Australia through (i) a one-year trial to integrate zoo-based wildlife health information reporting formally into the national surveillance system; and (ii) an analysis of the data obtained. 3. The third case study investigated the value of engaging the community in biosecurity surveillance. It reviewed the utility of data provided by the community in existing pest or disease eradication programs. This case study aimed to provide guiding principles on measuring (i) the likelihood that particular members of the community will detect a new or emerging pest or disease; and (ii) the reliability of reports submitted by particular members of the community.},

  abstract = {A wide range of tools and methodologies that are available to prove the pest or disease status of a country or region was reviewed in ACERA 1004. The review highlighted the set of tools that could be used to achieve or maintain market access. Most were used for ‘proof of freedom’ claims and were classified as relating to either survey design or to scenario-tree modelling, however, not all of these have been developed into readily applicable tools that could be easily and accurately applied by biosecurity managers with limited prior knowledge of the methodology. In this document we have detailed three survey design tools that have been developed from accepted statistical formulae and are well accepted in animal-disease surveillance: FreeCalc; EpiTools; and Survey Toolbox. We recommend that EpiTools be chosen for undertaking survey design and analysis. {\textbackslash}textbackslashpar After additional investigation into scenario tree modeling (including Bayesian Belief Networks) and associated generic software, the authors deem that this method requires too much prior knowledge and is not sufficiently clear that biosecurity managers or scientific staff could be reasonably expected to use and master it quickly. It appears unlikely that a tool will ever be developed that can effectively replace the amount of training that would be required to master scenariotree modeling. If scenario-tree modeling were required to make a proof-of-freedom claim, then it would be advisable to employ an expert who has had training in the use of this methodology, to undertake the analysis.},

The goal of the cafe was to engage community experts in discussions about volunteer biosecurity detection and monitoring (aka ‘community detectives’). Findings suggest that government officers, scientists, retirees, tradespeople, and representatives from conservation, Landcare and wildlife groups are interested, enthusiastic, knowledgeable and confident about biosecurity monitoring and detection. A significant opportunity to develop a community detectives network to capitalise on this research now exists.},

  abstract = {Post-border surveillance is used to give evidence that a pest or disease is absent from a country, region, or defined area, thus enabling access to particular export markets; detect new pests and diseases early enough to allow for cost-effective management; establish the boundaries of a known pest or disease; and monitor existing containment or eradication programmes. {\textbackslash}par A variety of tools exists to aid biosecurity managers plan, implement, and evaluate post-border surveillance activities. These were reviewed in Stages 1 and 2 of this project. Many of the tools and methods discussed in the review are, however, not easily applied by those involved in post-border surveillance due to both the complexity of the tools and time constraints on surveillance staff. {\textbackslash}par Previous milestone reports outlined two case studies that illustrate the application of two of these tools (Stage 3), and described their implementation in ways that would make them accessible to operational staff in Australian government agencies (Stage 4). The purpose of this report is to describe field tests of the tools, recommendations for modifications and developments to suit operational conditions, and (for case study ii) the test version of the software (Project Stage 5). {\textbackslash}par In summary, the two case studies explain: i. the use of EpiTools (a set of web-based tools) to create a survey strategy for demonstration of freedom from citrus canker in the Northern Territory; and ii. the use of an Excel-based eradograph-monitoring tool, to show progress towards regional extirpation of orange hawkweed in the Australian Alps.},

  abstract = {Although there is evidence that passive surveillance services provided by the public can be very valuable (in terms of both reduced program costs and increased probability of success in managing pests) little is known about the return on investment for this type of expenditure. {\textbackslash}par Enabling passive surveillance requires community information campaigns and incentive schemes. This takes funds away from other activities, so it is important to estimate the value of these campaigns relative to other alternatives, such as increasing active (structured) surveillance. {\textbackslash}par This project contributes towards an understanding of the value of passive surveillance provided by members of the community using a case study: the red imported fire ant (RIFA) eradication program in Brisbane. The RIFA program, managed by Biosecurity Queensland Control Centre (BQCC), is well documented. BQCC has an intense public awareness program with multiple activities, including broad and targeted coverage of distinct community groups and zones within the Brisbane area. We have combined data on community engagement events, reports from the public and nest detections recorded by BQCC, with census data to estimate relationships between demographic characteristics of an area and the likelihood that residents from that area will report encounters with RIFA. {\textbackslash}par In this report we present background information and hypotheses regarding the role of community surveillance in the management of biological invasions. This is followed by details of the datasets used and results of a number of analyses. We show the importance of the data clean-up process and identify the limitations that arise when a database designed primarily to track public reports is used for spatiotemporal analyses where accurate dating of events is important. {\textbackslash}par We also estimate the return on investment in community engagement in terms of the savings in structured-search costs it brings. This estimate uses probability maps to calculate the amount of active search that would have been required to detect all the known ant colonies in the period 2006-2010 if passive surveillance would not have been available. Assuming active search costs \$400/ha we obtain a value of \$52 million return per \$1 million invested in community engagement.},
