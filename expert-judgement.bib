  abstract = {Stochastic modelling of incursion risk is typically an iterative process. A model is developed which calculates likelihood of an adverse event based on parameter values. The parameter values are elicited from experts and Monte Carlo methods used to calculate the likelihood based on the model. In practice this is often an iterative process. The experts consider the likelihood generated by the model and their inputs and assess how consistent it is with their views. If it is inconsistent they can change their beliefs about parameter values, change their views about the incursion risk or even change the model. {\textbackslash}par We propose a new methodology to help support this process. In the new methodology we also formally elicit beliefs about the overall likelihood. We then provide a principled analysis of the consistency between the inputs and outputs. This will provide structure to the current ad hoc approaches, and will aid in the development and critiquing of models. {\textbackslash}par The approach simulates from bivariate conditional distributions formed from the input and output parameters given the model, which can converge to the required joint distribution and overcomes the issues noted in previous applications that lead to the Borel paradox. The approach also examines the uncertainties resulting from the model and has the potential to highlight dependencies (or lack thereof) associated with the output and each of the inputs. We illustrate the approach using a simple example and simulation and apply the approach to a case study examining the importation of mangoes in Australia and the risk associated with the establishment of the mango seed weevil in Australian orchards.},

  abstract = {The aim of this project was to review literature on the analysis of extreme risks, focusing primarily on ideas and developments in a range of disciplines that may be useful in the data poor environments typical of biosecurity risk assessments. {\textbackslash}par The report begins by outlining several case studies with varying levels of data, examining the role for extreme event risk analysis. The case studies include BA’s analysis of fire blight and New Zealand apples, bank operational risk and several technical failures. The report then surveys recent developments in methods relevant to evaluating extreme risks and evaluates their properties. These include methods for fraud detection in banks, formal extreme value theory, Bayesian approaches, qualitative reasoning, and adversary and advocacy models. The document includes a supplementary report as an appendix, providing an overview of the quantification of bank operational risks. {\textbackslash}par The report concludes that evaluations of extreme risks should be supported by quantitative analysis, even in data poor environments, but that the most effective strategies give the final word to qualitative reasoning. Evaluations are most effective when stakeholders and experts are able to examine and test data, models and reasoning, and when disagreements are heard by an independent arbitrator or panel.},

  abstract = {Scoring systems are commonly employed in risk analysis as a way of integrating information about a range of variables (called risk attributes) into a single risk score suitable for decision making. The construction of scoring systems is often criticised as being arbitrary as there is no transparent basis for the selection of weightings and integration methods. This paper describes an alternative approach which overcomes these difficulties. The method we detail is called Point of Truth Calibration. It is based on expert judgements on constructed risk scenarios rather than individual scores of risk attributes. We argue that it is an improved form of expert elicitation for many complex risk assessment problems. The proposed method will ‘automatically’ calibrate weightings (scores) of risk attributes from the overall risks given by experts using well developed statistical techniques. Several examples from biosecurity are presented to demonstrate the approach.},

  abstract = {This report seeks to enhance the Department of Agriculture’s existing biofouling risk assessment tools, which have been developed to underpin a proposed regulatory approach to biofouling on vessels entering Australian waters. The Invasive Marine Species Programme is in the process of implementing new biofouling management arrangements, and a risk assessment system (the Marine Growth Risk Assessment or MGRA) has been developed to accompany these. The MGRA will operate alongside existing quarantine pre-arrival processes, and consider information about vessel biofouling management such as presence and age of antifouling coating, history of recent hull survey and marine growth inspection, evidence of seawater pipe work treatment, duration of stay in overseas locations, and duration in Australian ports and coastal waters. However it does not have the capacity to identify high risk pathways based on compatibility between Australian ports, the temperature and salinity tolerance and distribution of invasive marine species of concern and the last ports visited by internationally arriving vessels. Here, we report on a project seeking to improve existing risk assessment methods by undertaking expert elicitation on various incursion scenarios, and statistical analysis of outputs. {\textbackslash}par The project involved twenty nine national and international experts each rating the relative risk of twenty comparative scenarios. These ratings were used to construct a statistical model emulator summarising the expert’s views. The summary of these is as follows. {\textbackslash}par The estimated impact of anti-fouling coat condition on relative risk was large, as expected. Compared to a new anti-fouling coat, having anti-fouling at 50\% of its service life increased the risk by a factor of about 2. Similarly, compared to a new anti-fouling coat, having anti-fouling at 100\% of its service life increased the risk by a factor of approximately 4. {\textbackslash}par Moving from an enclosed river port to a coastal port lowered the estimated risk by 54\% compared to moving between either coastal ports or river ports. {\textbackslash}par The environmental similarity of ports was inferred to be an important cue by experts. Each degree increase in the absolute difference in mean sea surface temperature from the port of origin changed the relative risk by 0.923 (c. 8\% decrease). Similarly, each unit change in the absolute difference in mean water salinity from the port of origin altered the relative risk by 0.97 (a 3\% decrease). {\textbackslash}par Each additional day of berthing increased the relative risk by 1.033 (a 3.3\% increase). {\textbackslash}par There was no evidence that experts consistently factored in similarity in tidal range, or voyage duration, into their estimates. {\textbackslash}par The model emulator developed is well-suited to risk ranking applications. It cannot be applied to determine absolute risk and therefore, given a threshold, whether a journeys risk is acceptable or not. If there was a requirement to do this, further analysis using the marginal rate of introductions would be needed. Thus the model as it stands could directly support compliance targeting. To apply it to primary estimation of risk would require both additional analysis as well as work to integrate it logically with the MGRA tool.},
