  abstract = {The aim of this project was to develop and evaluate methods to improve the prediction of species in geographic space. For some applications such as climate change and invasive species, these methods must be used to make predictions outside the ranges of the data used to build the models, making validation even more important. New methods have arisen in statistics and machine learning to deal with these issues. {\textbackslash}par This study uses simulated data to compare the performance of modeling methods. It concludes that some of new machine learning methods, in particular, boosted regression trees and maximum entropy methods, outperform statistical and climate matching methods under a number of performance measures, for a wide range of data types, data qualities and prediction circumstances. More importantly, the paper provides advice on how a user might evaluate the performance of predictive models, to make best use of the alternatives available to them for specific purposes. {\textbackslash}par This paper provides details of how to access software and statistical code to implement several of the better behaved and most promising methods.},

  abstract = {In this study we develop a spatially-explicit bioeconomic model of a biological invasion. The model integrates search theory, population dynamics and economic principles. {\textbackslash}par We address questions such as minimising the cost of eradication, minimising time to eradication or maximising the probability of eradication with a given budget. We develop simple decision tools to evaluate the minimum amount of funds that should be spent in information campaigns to enhance passive surveillance. {\textbackslash}par We derive trade-off curves to identify sets of efficient search and control strategies in terms of costs and probability of eradication. This tool will enable agencies to undertake useful policy analyses and contribute to the planning process. {\textbackslash}par We also develop an optimisation tool based on a genetic algorithm to find better search strategies in terms of three decisions: search effort allocated per site, buffer surveillance radius and number of repeat visits. {\textbackslash}par Our results provide useful insights into the design of efficient invasive-species control programs and suggest areas for further research and possible application of our tools to actual invasions. Among other outputs, this project delivers better ways to leverage and justify requests for funds to control biological invasions.},
