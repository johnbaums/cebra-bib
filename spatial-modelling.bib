  abstract = {The aim of this project was to develop and evaluate methods to improve the prediction of species in geographic space. For some applications such as climate change and invasive species, these methods must be used to make predictions outside the ranges of the data used to build the models, making validation even more important. New methods have arisen in statistics and machine learning to deal with these issues. {\textbackslash}par This study uses simulated data to compare the performance of modeling methods. It concludes that some of new machine learning methods, in particular, boosted regression trees and maximum entropy methods, outperform statistical and climate matching methods under a number of performance measures, for a wide range of data types, data qualities and prediction circumstances. More importantly, the paper provides advice on how a user might evaluate the performance of predictive models, to make best use of the alternatives available to them for specific purposes. {\textbackslash}par This paper provides details of how to access software and statistical code to implement several of the better behaved and most promising methods.},
