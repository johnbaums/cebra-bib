  abstract = {The aim of this project was to develop and evaluate methods to improve the prediction of species in geographic space. For some applications such as climate change and invasive species, these methods must be used to make predictions outside the ranges of the data used to build the models, making validation even more important. New methods have arisen in statistics and machine learning to deal with these issues. {\textbackslash}par This study uses simulated data to compare the performance of modeling methods. It concludes that some of new machine learning methods, in particular, boosted regression trees and maximum entropy methods, outperform statistical and climate matching methods under a number of performance measures, for a wide range of data types, data qualities and prediction circumstances. More importantly, the paper provides advice on how a user might evaluate the performance of predictive models, to make best use of the alternatives available to them for specific purposes. {\textbackslash}par This paper provides details of how to access software and statistical code to implement several of the better behaved and most promising methods.},

  abstract = {In this study we develop a spatially-explicit bioeconomic model of a biological invasion. The model integrates search theory, population dynamics and economic principles. {\textbackslash}par We address questions such as minimising the cost of eradication, minimising time to eradication or maximising the probability of eradication with a given budget. We develop simple decision tools to evaluate the minimum amount of funds that should be spent in information campaigns to enhance passive surveillance. {\textbackslash}par We derive trade-off curves to identify sets of efficient search and control strategies in terms of costs and probability of eradication. This tool will enable agencies to undertake useful policy analyses and contribute to the planning process. {\textbackslash}par We also develop an optimisation tool based on a genetic algorithm to find better search strategies in terms of three decisions: search effort allocated per site, buffer surveillance radius and number of repeat visits. {\textbackslash}par Our results provide useful insights into the design of efficient invasive-species control programs and suggest areas for further research and possible application of our tools to actual invasions. Among other outputs, this project delivers better ways to leverage and justify requests for funds to control biological invasions.},

  abstract = {This workshop aimed to bring together people with diverse but relevant expertise, to explore current best practice in spatial analysis and assess its relevance to the broad range of situations relevant to biosecurity risk assessments. Twenty five people from Australia and overseas attended, with expertise in spatial statistics, Bayesian analysis, statistical and mathematical modelling, invasion ecology and application of models in land management and conservation. The focus was methods for predicting distributions and movement of taxa that are not at equilibrium with their environment, such as invasive species or species whose distributions are changing due to climate change. The broad classes of methods usually applied to these problems include: (i) the same types of correlative models that are used to model current species distributions, optionally with modifications to represent the lack of equilibrium in the system or to represent physiological responses; (ii) models that explicitly focus on dispersal, spread and other population processes; and (iii) models that define important physiological constraints and identify those regions that satisfy the species requirements. {\textbackslash}par The group made substantial progress in a number of areas, and several participants will continue work after the group publish it in international journals. Several interesting ideas emerged that may lead to ongoing collaboration. Effort was spread over several topics: {\textbackslash}par 1. Clarifying where applications of correlative models are useful, and exploring how to fit them in a way most suited to non-equilibrium situations. This will lead to one review paper and at least one methodological paper. {\textbackslash}par 2. Comparing two alternative approaches to surveillance planning for the detection of weeds. {\textbackslash}par 3. Exploring the use of Bayesian hierarchical models for modelling species distributions, in a form that allows incorporation of important processes such as dispersal. As a case study, considering its use in predicting the invasion front for Cane toads in north western Australia. {\textbackslash}par 4. Developing realistic simulated data that enables assessment of alternative approaches for modelling distributions of invading species.},

  abstract = {Risk-based biosecurity surveillance systems rely, amongst other things, on reliable spatial models of the potential habitat of species of concern, often termed species distribution models (SDMs). A SDM can be used for a variety of purposes: - By understanding the possible extent of an incursion it can underpin the estimation of the potential economic, environmental and human health costs. - By combining an SDM with pathway analysis it can assist in prioritizing where surveillance effort should be expended to maximise the likelihood of early detection. {\textbackslash}par An understanding of the potential habitats the species can establish in can support eradication campaigns. A challenge in developing SDM’s is the diversity of techniques and opinion in the scientific literature. No one modelling technique has emerged as being suitable for all applications. In addition, while the importance of basing models on good predictive variables is understood conceptually there has been little attempt to review this or develop concrete protocols to identify these variables. {\textbackslash}par This project reviews the available environmental data and explores the information in the literature defining proximal variables, which are variables that are most directly and closely linked to the biological process and therefore likely to be the best predictors of potential distribution. The review identified that there is not a consistent approach within ecology to identifying proximal variables. While proximal variables are well defined conceptually, identifying them from observations of the species is more complex, because correlation can obscure causation. In other words, it is difficult to measure promixity. Thus while a variable may appear strongly predictive, its performance in other locations cannot be unambiguously predicted. {\textbackslash}par Based on this review the project then explored several approaches to developing predictive models. We developed methods to try to identify proximal variables statistically using small two variable models to guard against over-fitting. We also tested new microclimatic variables with a more physiological basis than those commonly used. Once variables were selected, we then tested a range of methods for making predictions to new regions, including (1) from a fitted model, (2) from climate envelopes constructed on the selected variables. The reason for the latter is that there are a number of compelling reasons that probability based predictions to new regions will be unreliable. These methods where then applied to five case studies using pests that have or could establish in Australia and/or New Zealand. There was no clear preferred approach from this analysis. {\textbackslash}par The basis of this result was explored via simulation analysis. This analysis demonstrated that variables could be strongly predictive in the native range but weakly predictive when projected to new locations. This demonstrated a fundamental limitation in our ability to accurately perform these projections with any of the tested models. {\textbackslash}par Based on these analyses a protocol was developed that reflects this inherent uncertainty. This protocol recommends experts based assessment of proximal variables and incorporation of this uncertainty into the analysis. It recommends the use of envelopes rather than probability methods when projecting to new locations.},

  abstract = {The Stage 1 prototype exposure model was designed to investigate the value of a Bayesian network (BN) based approach to estimating the probability of pest entry and exposures across New Zealand. It proved that the approach was practical and that it was able to capture our understanding of how pests enter the country. The Stage 2 model builds on the successful earlier model by expanding and improving it in a variety of ways. In addition, custom software (called Spear) has been created to run and manage the model and its associated results. {\textbackslash}par The Stage 1 model focussed on three main types of pest – Asian gypsy moth (AGM), woodboring and bark beetles (WBB) and Phytophthora – along with a host of associated items (such as containers, vehicles, sea vessels and passengers). We added two new pest classes – pine shoot moth (PSM) and Fusarium – which is less than the six new pests originally envisioned. After substantial consultation, we concluded that these five pests provide excellent coverage of the features of pests that may enter, and hence additional pest models were not needed. This gave us more time for other work, including elicitation, sensitivity analysis and Spear. {\textbackslash}par Stage 2 includes a Generic pest submodel that can be used to represent any pest at a low level of detail. The Generic pest can be used to handle a range of possibilities including: unknown threat; poorly understood pests and pest classe; new pests that may not fit any of the existing model; or simplified versions of existing pest classes that benefit from a common structure. In addition to the Generic pest submodel, the database and software used to drive the model was re-architected to allow for a clean separation of pests and items, allowing any pest to be combined with any item by merely specifying the appropriate parameters. {\textbackslash}par We explored the value of incorporating monthly factors into the exposure model. This work, which focussed on the AGM, showed that taking into account monthly factors does add value to the models, and has been extended to other pest submodels where those pests are influenced in important ways by seasonal factors. It also suggests there may be benefits in running the exposure model at a monthly resolution by default for certain pests. {\textbackslash}par Many improvements have been made to the parameters used in Stage 1. Most of the changes have been driven by elicitation workshops with experts and other individuals that have good familiarity with the domain. A modified version of the Delphi technique was used to elicit values for parameters such as infestation rates, detection rates and a range of pest- and item-specific parameters. While such parameters are always subject to large amounts of uncertainty, most of the parameters in the model are now well supported by data, literature or elicited estimates. {\textbackslash}par A substantial start has been made on performing a sensitivity analysis of the exposure models. Sensitivity analysis is critical to understanding the robustness of a model and to assessing how uncertainty impacts the conclusions we might draw. While time did not allow for a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of the full system, we have conducted analyses of several of the system’s key submodels. The results were insightful and influenced model development. They also highlighted key factors for which good estimates were required (such as the time spent by items and their pests at various locations), and other factors that were less important. {\textbackslash}par At a broad level, the resulting exposure maps appear reasonable, and match well with the maps produced by the original prototype exposure model. The results for AGM on the used vehicles pathway match very well with the results produced in Stage 1, and this is as expected given the robustness of that model. The maps for Phytophthora fare less well, but this was also expected due to the lack of knowledge surrounding Phytophthora and the changes made to its model. {\textbackslash}par An important output of the project is the software created to run and manage the models. Many parts of the exposure model will need to change over time. For example, the number of items entering the country will grow or contract from year to year, land use and population densities will shift across the country, and the location of transitional facilities, shops and tourist sites will not always remain the same. For any given year, the model needs to be updated to take account of these changes, and exposure maps will need to be regenerated. The software automates the running of the exposure model, along with all of the tasks needed to generate exposure maps. This allows the model to remain relevant well into the future, without requiring any core changes. Importantly, the software also allows for exploratory runs, with methods for run management built in, and provides tools for aggregating pathways in a way that allows for a rudimentary overall risk analysis. {\textbackslash}par The following is a summary of the key outcomes of this project: The exposure model provides an explicit, transparent, flexible and robust representation of the nature of an entry pathway and its constituent pathway points; The model provides good coverage of the key classes of pests that may affect forest health; The model allows unknown or poorly understood pests to be modelled with a Generic pest; The model can take account of seasonal factors; The model and software contains a clean separation of items and pests, and there is now greater flexibility in how pests and items can be combined; Model parameters and data can be updated independently to create new exposure maps; The model and its software can be deployed as part of a surveillance workflow (through its user interface) and can also be embedded in other software directly; The Spear software has been created and is flexible enough to be used for both this and future biosecurity projects. {\textbackslash}par The following future work is recommended: Further improvements to the software, in particular to improve the automation of data updates, as well as to improve the tools available for analysing the model results; Extension of the model to handle pests that arrive by wind; Further sensitivity analysis work, including a full system sensitivity analysis if feasible; Further refinement of the (expert-based) parameters through future elicitation workshops; One or more published papers on the exposure model and its software; Software integration with the survey optimisation work; Extension of the full system (i.e., including exposure, establishment and survey optimisation) into a full risk model, that allows for a complete and proper risk assessment; Formal validation of the model, including comparisons against existing systems, such as MPI’s High-Risk Surveillance Sites (HRSS) system.},

  abstract = {The Australian Department of Agriculture (Aust. DA) and the New Zealand Ministry of Primary Industries (NZ MPI) make various biosecurity decisions that require spatial predictions of the likelihood of pest occurrence or the suitability of potential habitat. A number of modelling tools can inform these decisions, which can be broadly characterised as correlative approaches and process-based approaches. The project used marine and terrestrial case studies to explore their ‘defensibility’, which focussed on their performance, and their ‘usability’, which focussed on their ease and cost of use. The project provided no clear consensus that currently available spatial tools will provide adequate solutions for all relevant scenarios. For the marine case it was concluded that a method is required that considers the degree of environmental similarity between source and sink environments, time in donor and recipient ports, and attributes from transit routes of vessels. For terrestrial scenarios it was concluded that process-based models are currently more appropriate for making defensible predictions, but may be more difficult to implement when data are poor and are thus not always suitable for government decision making. Hence, models were proposed that would use a mixture of expert opinion and correlative methods to determine key variables in the native range and the results would be used to make predictions in Australia/New Zealand. New research should explore the relative performance of these approaches and compare the practicalities of implementing them. Developing new methods will also require developing and retaining the expertise to apply them. This project is the basis for two new CEBRA projects that will implement the ideas that emerged: CEBRA projects 1402A: “Development of a marine spatial analysis model for improved biofouling risk assessment”; and 1402B: “Tools and approaches for invasive species distribution modelling for surveillance”.},
