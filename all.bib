	abstract = {A wide range of tools and methodologies that are available to prove the pest or disease status of a country or region was reviewed in ACERA 1004. The review highlighted the set of tools that could be used to achieve or maintain market access. Most were used for ‘proof of freedom’ claims and were classified as relating to either survey design or to scenario-tree modelling, however, not all of these have been developed into readily applicable tools that could be easily and accurately applied by biosecurity managers with limited prior knowledge of the methodology. In this document we have detailed three survey design tools that have been developed from accepted statistical formulae and are well accepted in animal-disease surveillance: FreeCalc; EpiTools; and Survey Toolbox. We recommend that EpiTools be chosen for undertaking survey design and analysis. {\textbackslash}textbackslashpar After additional investigation into scenario tree modeling (including Bayesian Belief Networks) and associated generic software, the authors deem that this method requires too much prior knowledge and is not sufficiently clear that biosecurity managers or scientific staff could be reasonably expected to use and master it quickly. It appears unlikely that a tool will ever be developed that can effectively replace the amount of training that would be required to master scenariotree modeling. If scenario-tree modeling were required to make a proof-of-freedom claim, then it would be advisable to employ an expert who has had training in the use of this methodology, to undertake the analysis.},

	abstract = {1.1 Introduction This report presents point and interval estimates of the future pathway risk and leakage for rural destination container inspection (RDI, also called Rural Tailgate Inspection), assuming a 100\% inspection rate behind a 30\% inspection rate for the External Container Inspection Regime (ECIR). The data used for the predictions were derived from AQIS inspection history and expert opinion. A simulation experiment was used to compute the estimates. {\textbackslash}par 1.2 Outcomes The specific outcomes are: • The expected pathway leakage rate for rural–destined containers, assuming 100\% inspection rate, 30\% inspection rate for the external container inspection regime (ECIR), and using 2008 inspection results, is 0.073\%. Reasonable upper and lower limits for this figure are (0.03\%, 0.13\%). • The expected pathway leakage rate for ECIR containers, using 2008 inspection results and 30\% inspection rate for ECIR, is 0.72\%. Reasonable upper and lower limits for this figure are (0.70\%, 0.75\%). • The expected contamination approach rate for ECIR containers, using 2008 inspection results, is 0.99\%. Reasonable upper and lower limits for this figure are (0.97\%, 1.01\%). {\textbackslash}par 1.3 Risk–return context In order to preferentially allocate resources to the activities that face the highest risk, the Cargo Branch is developing and implementing policies for the application of a risk-return approach on a number of activities. {\textbackslash}par Under Increased Quarantine Initiatives (IQI), Programs were nominally required to intervene for 100\% of volume, and obligated to achieve a minimum level of intervention. The prescribed minimum level varied across AQIS Programs. This approach provided information on the amount of activity that was to be undertaken and a numerical level that was to be achieved, as measures of performance. {\textbackslash}par Biosecurity risk management principles state that rather than focusing efforts on maintaining a prescribed level of activity or quantitative measure of performance, resources should be allocated on the basis of statistical intelligence and scientific assessment. Intervention levels should be responsive to changing risks, and performance should be measured against maintaining an acceptable level of risk. {\textbackslash}par Future risk management strategies will entail resourcing and guiding a level of intervention to maintain leakage at less than a determined level, where leakage is considered to be the (estimated) amount of undetected movement of goods or vessels of quarantine concern through an intervention process. {\textbackslash}par 1.3.1 Relevance to Beale review Among the many recommendations made by the Beale report (Beale et al., 2008), this study directly targets: {\textbackslash}par 44 The balance and level of biosecurity resources across the continuum should be determined by a consistent analysis of risks and returns across programs.

	abstract = {This report follows Robinson et al. (2009) and supersedes Robinson et al. (2010). {\textbackslash}par 1.1 Outcomes We define whole pathway level leakage as the estimated rate of undetected failures across all routine first-port inspections. All statistics are computed using visits to class D ports (defined herein). {\textbackslash}par 1. We estimate the whole pathway level approach rate for contamination to be 4.37\%. {\textbackslash}par 2. We conservatively estimate the whole pathway level leakage following the adoption of Phase 1, as defined in this report, to be 0.42\%. (a) This estimate assumes that inspections are 100\% effective. (b) This estimate is conservative. A better supported estimate is 0.33\%. (c) The estimated whole-pathway rate of contamination that is of biological concern is 0.22\%. (d) The estimate ignores any leakage that corresponds to previously uninspected portions of the pathways (e.g., Bunkers and ship-to-ship transfers). This omission results from inability to distinguish such records in VMS. (e) The estimate is lower than 0.62\%, which was projected by Robinson et al. (2009). The alteration is due to using more data and an improved computation algorithm. (f) This estimate should be compared with 0.17\%, which is the average leakage that was effectively mandated under Increased Quarantine Intervention (IQI)1 . It is more than two times higher than the previously-mandated leakage. (g) We estimate the leakage within the pathways that fall under Phase 1 to be 1.69\%. Leakage that is of biological concern is estimated as 1.11\%. {\textbackslash}par 3. We conservatively predict that the whole pathway level leakage following the adoption of Phase 2, as defined in this report, in addition to Phase 1 will be 0.61\%. (a) This estimate assumes that inspections are 100\% effective. (b) This estimate is conservative. A better supported estimate is 0.47\%. (c) The estimated whole-pathway rate of contamination that is of biological concern is 0.28\%. (d) The estimate ignores any leakage that corresponds to previously uninspected portions of the pathways. (e) We estimate the leakage specific to Phase 2, that is, the leakage specifically within the pathways that fall under Phase 2, to be 0.57\%. Leakage that is of biological concern is estimated as 0.35\%. {\textbackslash}par 4. The increase in risk that results from a reduction in intervention in the routine first-port inspection pathway should be offset by a concomitant increase in intervention in a riskier pathway. Examples of such opportunities include ballast water, biofouling, and validation inspections. {\textbackslash}par 5. We recommend that steps be taken to align the data capture, processing, and storage for recording the Quarantine Pre-arrival Report for Vessels (QPAR) and subsequent inspections with the requirements of the business rules. {\textbackslash}par 1.2 Risk–return context In order to preferentially allocate resources to the activities that face the highest risk, the Cargo Branch is developing and implementing policies for the application of a risk-return approach on a number of activities. {\textbackslash}par Under Increased Quarantine Initiatives (IQI), Programs were required to intervene for 100\% of volume, and obligated to achieve a minimum level of intervention. The prescribed minimum level varied across AQIS Programs. This historical approach provides, as a measure of performance, information on the level of activity that is to be undertaken and a numerical standard that is to be achieved. {\textbackslash}par Biosecurity risk management principles state that rather than focusing efforts on maintaining a prescribed level of activity or quantitative measure of performance, resources should be allocated on the basis of statistical intelligence and scientific assessment.

This type of surveillance relies on members of the public, industry groups, plant or animal health professionals and their networks, and/or laboratories reporting suspected cases of plant or animal disease or the presence of a pest at their discretion. The research consisted of a review of new technologies for rapid, field-based (point-of-care) testing in the detection of emergency animal diseases and three case studies: 1. The first case study assessed the requirements for Australia’s ongoing surveillance for detection of ruminant diseases by (i) identifying and ranking factors that most influence the probability of early detection of various significant diseases of ruminants; and (ii) outlining surveillance programs that provide options for the early detection of diseases for different levels of confidence. 2. The second case study assessed the value of wildlife surveillance data gathered through zoo-based veterinary hospitals in Australia through (i) a one-year trial to integrate zoo-based wildlife health information reporting formally into the national surveillance system; and (ii) an analysis of the data obtained. 3. The third case study investigated the value of engaging the community in biosecurity surveillance. It reviewed the utility of data provided by the community in existing pest or disease eradication programs. This case study aimed to provide guiding principles on measuring (i) the likelihood that particular members of the community will detect a new or emerging pest or disease; and (ii) the reliability of reports submitted by particular members of the community.},

	abstract = {Background: DAFF has adopted a risk-based approach to managing the biosecurity risk of various pathways, including international passengers and mail. During Increased Quarantine Intervention (IQI), introduced in 2001, inspection effectiveness had been used as the primary indicator of inspectorate performance. A risk-based approach to management requires a richer suite of indicators that will better align with DAFF values. ACERA Project 1001i Performance Indicators recommended post-intervention compliance (PIC) of the pathway as a performance indicator. {\textbackslash}par Overview: This project focuses on broadening the scope of the indicators, implementing them for the international passengers pathway, and assessing the effect on prioritization of passenger cohorts for further intervention. {\textbackslash}par Outcomes: – The recommended indicators are: ∗ Before intervention compliance (BIC), ∗ Post-intervention compliance (PIC), ∗ Non-compliance effectiveness (NCE), and ∗ Hit rate (HR). These indicators are simple and robust measures of performance, accounting for compliance and inspectorate performance before and after arrival. – Three of the indicators can be computed with existing data collections, namely BIC, PIC and NCE. HR can be computed for some sub-pathways, but better tracking information is needed, that is, information about all the intervention steps that the passengers have followed. – The data prior to June 2012 were not sufficiently detailed. Collection categories have been amended to enable calculation of all indicators at the desired granularity. – No substantial implications are anticipated for the profiling methodology as a result of adopting these performance measures. With profiling, the categories with the highest approach rate are targeted. The approach remains the same under the new performance measures. – The performance measures can be used to produce new standard reports for monitoring performance. These reports are control charts—as used for statistical process control—but are tailored to DAFF’s operational environment. Importantly, they include confidence intervals to show the uncertainty in each performance indicator. Examples are provided in Chapter 6. {\textbackslash}par Recommendations: – The reported performance indicators should be used to assess how appropriately and how well the inspectorate performs, with PIC as the key indicator (p 23). – Profiles for international passengers and mail articles should still be based on the approach rate (p 24). – Performance indicators should be reported with confidence intervals wherever possible, to enable accurate assessment of the quality of the available information (p 14). – The nominal coverage of the confidence intervals should be no less than 90\% (p 14). – DAFF should determine what would be the effect upon the statistical qualities of the performance indicators of using a sampling approach to counting Incoming Passenger Cards (IPCs) instead of counting all of them (p 21). – DAFF should undertake a further study to determine when and how to cluster small cohorts, and what is the effect upon profiling of that clustering, and what other options—for example, empirical Bayes estimates—might be available for handling small cohorts (p 22). – DAFF should consider whether the cutoff for high-risk cohorts should be the mean approach rate or some higher confidence interval (or, before-intervention compliance, BIC, or lower interval). The mean is the best indicator of compliance, but the higher confidence interval acknowledges that ignorance is a source of risk (p 32). – Leakage surveys need to be representative in order to reduce uncertainty about the compliance of individual cohorts. DAFF should investigate how to assess and report the representativeness of the leakage survey (p 33). – DAFF should review the choice of performance indicators and the data collection procedures within one year (p 23).},

It reviews current approaches used to prioritize biosecurity resources, focusing especially on the criteria used to characterise consequence and the way in which they are combined. {\textbackslash}par Six limitations are identified in current decision support protocols: 1. Vague formulation of the decision problem 2. Vague use of language 3. Poor estimation of likelihood in the prediction of expected consequences 4. Confusing means and ends objectives 5. Assigning arbitrary value judgments (or avoiding value judgments altogether) 6. Reluctance to include uncertainty {\textbackslash}par A prototype framework that seeks to address these limitations is outlined. The framework is built on theories of subjective expected utility and multi-attribute value, providing a structured means for coherently combining subjective predictions of cause-and-effect elicited from experts and the value judgments of decision-makers. It accommodates the market and non-market impacts of pest invasion. It has the potential to provide operational meaning to the concept of ‘risk return’ across the biosecurity continuum. The framework comprises five essential steps: Step 1 Define the decision frame Step 2 Define objectives and performance measures Step 3 Develop alternatives Step 4 Estimate consequences Step 5 Evaluate trade-offs and select an alternative {\textbackslash}par The report illustrates conceptual application of the framework in three biosecurity settings: (a) prioritising pests; (b) assessing the merit of alternative actions; and (c) conducting pest risk assessments under international rules governing trade.},

	abstract = {The Emergency Plant Pest Response Deed is a legally binding agreement between plant industries and government that specifies cost-sharing arrangements in the event of a pest incursion. The core principle underpinning cost-sharing is that beneficiaries of the eradication of an emergency plant pest pay an appropriate and equitable proportion of the costs of mounting a response. Stakeholders hold different views on what might be considered ‘appropriate and equitable’. The Pest Categorisation Questionnaire is a decision-support protocol that informs cost-sharing arrangements. This report critiques the Pest Categorisation Questionnaire, highlighting weaknesses and potential remedies. {\textbackslash}par There are three main problems embedded in the current protocol: 1. The protocol is ambiguous in its interpretation of the cost-sharing principle of the EPPRD. Some elements imply a cost-sharing arrangement whereby government pays according to the magnitude of impact on public values, irrespective of the magnitude of impact on private values. 2. The point scoring procedure underpinning the protocol can lead to clearly erroneous categorisation. 3. The verbal descriptors of impact (‘major’, ‘moderate’ and ‘minor’) are poorly defined, leading to assessments that confound predictions of impact with value judgments of the importance of those impacts. {\textbackslash}par Collectively, these problems lead to inconsistent categorisations. {\textbackslash}par We propose four improvements to the Pest Categorisation Questionnaire to remedy these problems: 1. Amend the decision tree for pest categorisation. 2. Clearly align each question to either public impacts or private impacts. 3. Clarify the IF-THEN rules that define cost-sharing categories. 4. Clarify what is meant by verbal descriptors of impact, and assign points accordingly. {\textbackslash}par Negotiation among key stakeholders is required to calibrate what is meant by ‘major’, ‘moderate’ and ‘minor’ impacts for public and private interests. Calibration will provide clarity on the extent to which public and private beneficiaries of eradication are required to pay.},

This development is important because it simplifies some recent advances in scenario tree techniques that are being used increasingly, especially in animal disease management, to substantiate claims of disease freedom.

One of their limitations is that for relatively complicated systems, such as surveillance systems for animal diseases that use multiple sources of information, the scenario trees can become large and complex. This report demonstrates how to simplify large scenario trees by ‘pruning’ redundant branches. It also shows that in many situations, scenario trees can be presented as Bayesian networks, thereby taking advantage of a considerable body of knowledge, software and expertise for building and testing systems that support claims of disease freedom.},

	abstract = {1.1 Background Quarantine inspection assists in safeguarding Australia’s biosecurity status by monitoring import pathways for contamination. Once identified, contaminated pathways can be mitigated. Using inspection history to analyse intercepted biosecurity risk is an important process in ensuring that inspection regimes and resourcing match a commodity’s risk profile and pathway failure rate. {\textbackslash}par This project, by the Australian Centre for Excellence in Risk Analysis (ACERA) and Plant Quarantine staff, reviewed the risk–return potential of imported-plant product pathways to optimize the allocation of Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF) inspection resources. Specifically, our goal was to find a way to reduce the amount of inspection without unduly increasing the leakage, defined as the amount of quarantine contamination that passes undetected. This report summarizes the results of a statistical risk analysis of inspection data for plant-product pathways. {\textbackslash}par The target of risk return for imported-plant product pathways is to implement reduced monitoring rates for identified low-risk pathways while still maintaining an acceptably low level of risk of new quarantine incursions, and to allocate the ensuing resources to managing high-risk pathways. Of the 10 pathways examined, 7 were found to be low risk. The resources used to sample these at the border can be partially reallocated to pathways of greater risk. Overall, compliant suppliers will be rewarded and risky pathways will be more adequately addressed. {\textbackslash}par The project team used an evidence-based risk approach, as recommended by Beale et al. (2008), to determine high and low risk based on the inspection failure rate and end use of each pathway. This report documents ACERA project 1001J, which is a pre-cursor to a future project, ACERA Project 1101C, Quarantine Inspection and Auditing Across the Biosecurity Continuum.},

Previously, CSIRO developed methods to generate tables that report estimates of the risk of the transfer of marine pests by ballast water between Australian ports (ballast water risk tables). {\textbackslash}par Overview: We reviewed the existing workflow for risk table construction and reconstituted the entire construction process within the readily available statistical software environment R. The table generation process was further modularised for ease of use and to allow risk tables to be updated without necessarily running the entire process. {\textbackslash}par Outcomes: We identify under what circumstances risk table updates should occur and how they should be carried out. The new R code was tested by reproducing CSIRO’s previous results for the ballast water risk tables, using the same past input datasets. The new code has been used to produce a revised set of ballast water risk tables using preliminary updated port survey datasets. A key outcome of this project is that ABARES now has a good understanding of the risk table methodology and the code used to generate the risk tables. {\textbackslash}par Recommendations: That ABARES undertake the regular analytical maintenance of the risk tables on behalf of DAFF, with appropriate remuneration from the client Program.},

	abstract = {Stochastic modelling of incursion risk is typically an iterative process. A model is developed which calculates likelihood of an adverse event based on parameter values. The parameter values are elicited from experts and Monte Carlo methods used to calculate the likelihood based on the model. In practice this is often an iterative process. The experts consider the likelihood generated by the model and their inputs and assess how consistent it is with their views. If it is inconsistent they can change their beliefs about parameter values, change their views about the incursion risk or even change the model. {\textbackslash}par We propose a new methodology to help support this process. In the new methodology we also formally elicit beliefs about the overall likelihood. We then provide a principled analysis of the consistency between the inputs and outputs. This will provide structure to the current ad hoc approaches, and will aid in the development and critiquing of models. {\textbackslash}par The approach simulates from bivariate conditional distributions formed from the input and output parameters given the model, which can converge to the required joint distribution and overcomes the issues noted in previous applications that lead to the Borel paradox. The approach also examines the uncertainties resulting from the model and has the potential to highlight dependencies (or lack thereof) associated with the output and each of the inputs. We illustrate the approach using a simple example and simulation and apply the approach to a case study examining the importation of mangoes in Australia and the risk associated with the establishment of the mango seed weevil in Australian orchards.},

There are three distinct research outputs all linked by the use of Bayesian Networks for representing environmental problems with regard to information, its uncertainty, its assessment and decision processes. The outputs are: {\textbackslash}par i) Investigation of using Bayesian networks in environmental assessments that involve assessing natural resource conditions. This provides the rationale for linking Bayesian network models with spatial information and addresses aspects of how data is utilised in assessments. Two practical applications are presented for a land use risk model and vegetation condition assessment. {\textbackslash}par ii) A software tool was developed to link Bayesian network models to data in a GIS. It is used extensively in the previous investigation. The tool supports developing spatial models as Bayesian networks and the handling of data parameters and their uncertainties. Furthermore it identifies an archetypical way of combining mapping and monitoring data in environment assessment and natural resource applications. {\textbackslash}par iii) Investigation of Bayesian decision networks to find optimal solutions for management interventions in natural resource applications.

	abstract = {This report focuses on the inspection of export goods for destination countries that do not specify inspection sampling rates for those goods. Two issues are tackled, namely, (i) what is the appropriate level of sampling for consignments that comprise mixes of products, and (ii) whether there is any scope for the use of compliance-based sampling for inspection of plant products that are to be exported. {\textbackslash}par Part A: Sampling mixed consignments It is possible that the sampling of mixed consignments can be carried out in a way that satisfies Australia’s obligations under the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM) No. 31 (FAO, 2008). • The current policy of allowing the exporter a choice of 600 units or 2\% inspection does not satisfy Australia’s obligations under ISPM 31. – Exporters will most likely choose the least stringent protocol. When 2\% of the total unit count is less than 600 units, an inspection of 2\% does not have a 95\% chance of detecting contamination at a rate of 0.5\% or higher. • Inspection of a simple random sample of 600 units from a mixed consignment does satisfy Australia’s obligations under ISPM 31. – The obligations refer to the consignment, not to the lines within the consignment. – However, if the 600-unit inspection detects contamination then the entire consignment should be rejected. A practice of dropping or replacing a contaminated line does not provide a 95\% chance of detecting contamination of 0.5\% or higher in the un-sampled units. – In order to provide an appropriate level of protection within a system that permits dropping or swapping lines, it would be necessary to (i) verify that cross-contamination cannot have happened, and (ii) inspect 600 different units after dropping / swapping. • Stratification of a mixed consignment into lines, splitting a 600-unit sample proportionally to line volume between the lines, and inspecting a simple random sample from each line to a total of at least 600 units (rounding fractional units up), is a reasonable device to handle the biosecurity risk of mixed consignments. – DAWR should consider using PEMS to monitor the sampling effort devoted to different products, and directing inspection efforts specifically or generally to ensure that reasonably up-todate information about apparently low-risk products is maintained. • Most commonly, the samples taken for inspection are clustered by packaging, e.g., selection of a number of crates of fruit. Such a sample design is called cluster sampling. – A clustered, 600 unit inspection provides a 95\% chance of detecting randomly distributed contamination at a rate of 0.5\% or higher. – A clustered, 600 unit inspection does not provide a 95\% chance of detecting clustered contamination, e.g., contamination that is transmitted by contact within crates, at a rate of 0.5\% or higher. Part B: Compliance-Based Sampling It is unlikely that compliance-based sampling, such as the CSP algorithms employed by Imported Plant Products, can be successfully implemented in the export space. • It would be necessary to collect data at an unprecedented level of detail from each consignment, including, for example, the supplier and geographical region of each line. • Even then it would be necessary to assume that inspection history was in some way continuous within supplier and region, from consignment to consignment. The biological variability of the underlying system mitigates against this assumption.},

	abstract = {The Department of Agriculture and Water Resources (the department) seeks to mitigate the inherent biosecurity risk of various pathways by various control measures. This project involved the deployment of data-mining tools on a collection of data resources held by the department. {\textbackslash}par The overall results of the data mining exercises are very encouraging; in each completed sub-project the tools were able to develop statistically reliable models that produced operationally realistic predictions. Where appropriate, these models have been provided to the department for use in profiling. When the models led to insights that suggest further developments might be called for, these potential developments have been articulated. In the reports for all completed sub-projects, detailed recommendations have been made regarding further data that could be collected to improve modelling as well as the refinements to the modelling should such data be made available. {\textbackslash}par The List of Recommendations includes specific recommendations that arise from the case studies and corrective actions that may improve the accuracy and credibility of decisions arising from analyses of the data. Most of the recommended changes are procedural, carrying minimal if any additional cost. {\textbackslash}par Specific outcomes of the sub-projects are summarized below. {\textbackslash}par 1. Spatial analysis of international mail interceptions. • Aim: to explore the spatial distribution and patterns of the destination address of mail articles seized with biosecurity risk material. • Outcome: spatial patterns of interceptions were identified, and linkages made with information from ABS census data. High-risk demographics were identified, and potential policy remedies discussed. • Next: analysis could include incorporation of mail count data from the Sydney Gateway Facility, and land-use classification for each postcode. It is likely that the techniques used here will also be useful for profiling in the air cargo pathway. {\textbackslash}par 2. Generalised pattern analysis for international passengers. • Aim: to assess the value of Border passenger information for profiling international air passengers to improve inspection efficiency by (i) allowing more timely allocation of inspection resources, and (ii) more accurate profiles using more information than is available on the Incoming Passenger Card. • Outcome: statistical models provide respectable predictive ability of the outcome of passenger inspection based on historical data, but the study suffers several critical shortcomings. • Next: assess the potential benefits and challenges of implementing any outcomes from the study before trying to correct the shortcomings. {\textbackslash}par 3. Detecting anomalous broker activity. • Aim: to outline analyses of the propensity of brokers to amend declarations after receiving quarantine directions of different nature. • Outcome: very little evidence of a link between alterations to import declarations and quarantine directions of different kinds among the brokers assessed in this analysis. Some evidence of alteration of CP risk status from high to low upon direction. • Next: the department should note these results and consider surveillance on items that correspond with amended declarations. {\textbackslash}par 4. Risk factor extraction with VMS. • Aim: to identify risk factors using data from the Vessel Management System (VMS) dataset, in order to be able to predict inspection failure. • Outcome: the aim of determining risk factors for vessels has been achieved with the data available. • Next: improve data capture for vessel agents (75\% missing in dataset) and consider future analysis along comparable lines. {\textbackslash}par 5. Transfer Learning. • Aim: to explore possibilities of sharing information among similar but arguably unalike pathways. • Outcome: this sub-project was withdrawn owing to time and resource constraints. • Next: no further steps at this time. {\textbackslash}par 6. Performance indicators for Cargo Compliance Verification. • Aim: to develop measures that allow reporting compliance across all cargo pathways. • Outcome: Performance measures are developed and reported. • Next: obtain Customs data of all cargo to enable the calculation of key system-wide measures. Produce summaries at the policy level. {\textbackslash}par 7. Analysis of hitch-hikers interception data. • Aim: to test the hypothesis that the arrival of specific hitchhiker pests on imported cargo can be anticipated based on pest biology and known distribution. • Outcome: this sub-project was withdrawn as insufficient interception data were available, and those data that were available were of inadequate quality. • Next: the department should identify and remedy the gaps in data capture and curation that undermined the successful prosecution of this study.},

	abstract = {The application of decision support tools is an emerging field in biosecurity management. The goal of this report is to compare two well-known decision frameworks - cost benefit analysis (CBA) and multi-criteria analysis (MCA) - to support biosecurity decision-making. {\textbackslash}par Sharing common conceptual roots, the ultimate reason for applying both frameworks is to maximise net benefit or utility in decision-making. While CBA aims to achieve economic efficiency, MCA’s primary concern is effectiveness. Such differences triggered a debate over CBA and MCA in the 1960s. However, over time the “either…or” debate has been replaced by a more constructive discussion of a complementary nature. Therefore, instead of arguing, “Which framework is more universally preferred,” we attempted to answer the questions of “When is it better to use CBA or MCA” and “How can the two frameworks be jointly applied and mutually enhanced in biosecurity management?” {\textbackslash}par We form a list of potential factors that will influence the choice and procedural details of CBA and MCA from a literature review. We then identify ten factors that are most relevant to biosecurity management. These factors include, urgency of the decision problem, whether the invasive species and/or its management effort has any non-market impact, whether there are well-defined pre-existing biosecurity management options, level of scientific uncertainty, availability of non-market valuation studies, funding, technical capacity, stakeholders’ interest, degree of public agreement, and political mandate . {\textbackslash}par Among these factors, we believe ‘political mandate’ will favour the choice of CBA, and ‘(low degree) of public agreement’ and ‘(high level) of scientific uncertainty’ can nudge decisionmakers in the direction of MCA. The remaining seven factors will only have an effect on the specific procedures of biosecurity decision-making after either CBA or MCA is chosen. {\textbackslash}par Most importantly, we develop a conceptual framework to combine the features of both CBA and MCA in their “pure” form to create a win-win situation for biosecurity management. In essence, this framework integrates the ‘breadth’ and representativeness of CBA and the ‘depth’ in analysis and deliberation of MCA. We demonstrate how to apply this framework with two decision trees and one case study. One tree features CBA as the dominant tool, complemented by four elements of MCA, while, in the other, MCA is the main decision-aid and is complemented by three CBA components. The case study integrates choice modelling and MCA and offers an innovative decision-making model for biosecurity management by combining the CBA feature of broader representativeness and the MCA characteristic of open and in-depth group process.},

	abstract = {The National Environmental Biosecurity Response Agreement (NEBRA) establishes the national cost-sharing arrangements between the Commonwealth, States and Territories for responding to significant pest and disease incursions, including in the marine context. When an incursion is of national significance, potentially eligible for cost sharing under NEBRA, and likely to be eradicable, the notifying party responsible for the original notification must supply additional information to assist with decision-making. A benefit-cost analysis (BCA) is one of these key pieces of information. {\textbackslash}par Development of the initial BCA must be undertaken relatively quickly and ideally by staff with experience in developing BCAs. A particularly difficult aspect of BCA development is identifying and valuing the ‘non-market’ impacts of the pest on marine environments. In the time-critical context of responding to a marine pest incursion it can be difficult to find (or reallocate) in-house staff with skills in developing BCAs in general, or for marine pest incursions in particular. Some jurisdictions outsource BCA development to consultants experienced in BCA. However, resources may not be available to outsource development of the BCA in all cases. {\textbackslash}par This report provides guidance to staff within jurisdictions – economists and noneconomists – on preparing a BCA for a marine pest incursion. A set of notated guidelines takes staff through the steps required in a BCA and detailed advice is provided in a series of appendices. The guidelines are based on those provided by the Office of Best Practice Regulation, and are consistent with requirements of the NEBRA. They are also intended to improve consistency in BCA development.

	abstract = {Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) has been identified as the single greatest disease threat to Australia’s livestock industries. Vaccination is increasingly being recognised as an important tool to assist in containing and eradicating FMD outbreaks. The two options for vaccinated animals at the end of an outbreak are to remove them from the population in order to expedite regaining FMD-free status (‘vaccinate-and-remove’), or to keep the animals in the population and allow them to live out their normal commercial lives (‘vaccinate-and-retain’). More than 90\% of the economic costs of an FMD outbreak in Australia would arise from revenue losses caused by immediate and prolonged export bans by Australia’s FMD sensitive markets. Following an outbreak of FMD, surveillance will be required to demonstrate that infection has been eradicated from the population in order to meet international requirements to regain FMD-free status and to satisfy trading partners so as to regain access to international markets. Although there is growing interest in vaccinate-and-retain policy for the control of FMD to avoid the need for large scale culling of at-risk animals, keeping vaccinated animals in the population will make achieving recognition of free status more difficult under current international rules. {\textbackslash}par From a policy perspective it would be very useful if disease managers had access to decision support tools that could be used to evaluate policies and approaches to regain FMD-free status and facilitate early return to trade. This project expanded the functionality of the Australian Animal Disease model (AADIS) currently being used by animal health authorities in Australia to support FMD planning and preparedness, to include capacity to evaluate different approaches to post-outbreak surveillance in previously infected areas and a module for post-outbreak management of vaccinated animals. {\textbackslash}par To demonstrate how the improved functionality can be used, case studies of hypothetical outbreaks in Qld, WA and Vic. are reported. These studies involved comparing different approaches to disease control and post-outbreak management. In the first study, vaccination used with stamping out provided no improvement over stamping out on its own in the Qld case study scenario, provided a small but significant improvement in the WA case study and was highly effective in reducing the size and duration of the outbreak in the Vic. case study. This finding highlights that when it comes to considering the use of vaccination, a ‘one size fits all’ approach is not appropriate. {\textbackslash}par In the second demonstration study we showed how a reduced sampling intensity surveillance approach used with a control program not involving vaccination, could significantly reduce the number of samples collected and the cost of the post-outbreak surveillance program without increasing the risk of missing residual infected herds when compared to a baseline surveillance based on the European Union FMD Directive. However, when emergency vaccination is used, there was a high likelihood that some vaccinated herds will be exposed to infection and under a vaccinateand-retain policy, post-outbreak surveillance programs, even when census sampling is used, cannot be guaranteed to find all of these herds. ‘There is a risk that some animals in vaccinated herds that were exposed to FMD virus could have been infected and some of these could be carriers. Recovered animals that are not carriers do not pose a risk of transmitting FMD. Carriers are considered a potential but unquantified risk for spread of FMD. After a comprehensive surveillance program the risk of carriers remaining in the population is low but not zero.’ {\textbackslash}par The third demonstration study compared (a) vaccinate-and-retain; (b) vaccinate-and-remove (slaughter to waste) and (c) vaccinate-and-remove (slaughter and salvage) policies for managing vaccinated animals. The vaccinate-and-remove strategies were associated with higher post-outbreak management costs but lower loss of trade costs. In terms of overall cost, there would be significant savings compared to the vaccinate-and-retain policy. From a cost point of view there was no advantage of removal with salvage compared to removal to waste under the study assumptions. Any savings made through salvage are offset by trade losses associated with longer time required to remove all vaccinated animals, and regain markets. {\textbackslash}par This project has developed and demonstrated modelling functionality to support policy development around important issues to facilitate regaining FMD free status and regaining market access after an FMD outbreak. However, the limited nature of the studies and uncertainty around some parameters means that more work is required before it is possible to provide clear advice and guidelines to disease managers. It is anticipated that the work done in this project will continue under a MLACSIRO FMD project funded under the Rural R\&D for Profit Program.},

The monitoring service they use is provided on contract by a third party. The Great Lakes Commission has been concurrently using and refining its software to monitor e-commerce of invasive species into the Laurentian Great Lakes region. The Australian Department of Agriculture \& Water Resources has a manual monitoring program, which is augmented by intelligence received from a non-profit organisation, the Invasive Species Council. {\textbackslash}par The systems that most closely meet the software requirements advised by NZ MPI, or whose available descriptions suggest they may, are 1. IBIS Replacement — an as yet unnamed system that can perform fully customisable searches of the internet, potentially including e-commerce monitoring 2. GLDIATR — the system developed by the Great Lakes Commission to monitor e-commerce in its member jurisdictions 3. iTrade — a system in the early stages of development by the University of Kent for detecting probable sales of illegal wildlife items; and 4. ETH Zurich’s unnamed system developed for researching e-commerce trade in invasive plants. {\textbackslash}par In selecting a system for use, or in developing an entirely new system, the following factors — beyond normal software procurement practice — should be considered: 1. the technical and legal issues with scraping data from websites 2. the inability to obtain details of persons who actually purchase goods online 3. the need to invest in developing and maintaining effective query parameters; and 4. if automated text processing techniques are used, the need to invest in the development and maintenance of effective algorithms and any associated ontologies. {\textbackslash}par Finally, there are several opportunities for collaboration on the further development of automated e-commerce surveillance capability, notably with organisations and researchers active in biosecurity and wildlife trade regulation and advocacy.},

	abstract = {This report assesses tools for measuring the costs of human morbidity and mortality, with a focus on their utility for biosecurity risk assessment. The approaches described include case-based approaches, disability adjusted life years (DALYs), quality adjusted life years (QALYs), cost of illness studies (COI), willingness to pay (WTP), and integrated quantitative/semi-quantitative approaches. The report finds that DALYs are most useful as measures of population health burden of disease and QALYs as measures of the effectiveness of interventions. DALYs should be used for making comparisons between and among zoonotic and nonzoonotic diseases. Conversion of measures to dollars could be useful whenever budgetary decisions are determined by monetary costs and when such inputs are required for cost–benefit analyses. {\textbackslash}par If a wider set of consequences is considered, the review recommends cost of illness (COI) studies. The report suggests that a bottom–up approach is more suitable for measuring monetary burden of illness due to zoonotic diseases. The willingness-to-pay (WTP) approach may be warranted if ‘intangible’ costs are important. Structured decision methods provide a means for partitioning the scientific assessment of the total cost or burden of disease, from the social choices that emerge in setting priorities.},

In particular the papers focus on the BioMetric and Habitat Hectares measures of site quality, developed for use in New South Wales and Victoria respectively, and on the Cumberland Plain Woodland vegetation type. The papers find that uncertainty regarding current and expected future vegetation quality is a significant issue for investment planning. Inaccurate measures can lead to declines in biodiversity value and reduce the cost effectiveness of investments in vegetation restoration. Improving the accuracy of the measures and making planning processes more robust to failures of restoration actions to enhance biodiversity outcomes are important implications. There appears to be less scope for improving the precision of the measures and this is likely to be costly. A useful extension of the work would be to undertake a spatially explicit landscape scale analysis although this would require landscape scale measures of vegetation quality.

We studied fresh and dried dates, medium-risk nursery stock (MRNS), and mediumrisk plant-based stockfeed (PBS). {\textbackslash}par Outcomes: The inspection of fresh as well as dried dates can be managed using the CSP–3 tool under the single tariff for dates, splitting the pathway by importer. There is considerable variation between the regions on the rate at which contamination is detected within the MRNS pathway. Altering the cutoff number of contaminated plants that constitutes a quarantine failure in MRNS has a minimal effect upon the pathway-level contamination rate, and further consideration is not justified. Analyzing the patterns of contamination in PBS is very challenging because it has so far proved impossible to develop an inspection database owing to the lack of a definitive identifier for the pathway. Several pathways in the fruit tariff chapter are identified as low or high risk by use of simple data mining tools. {\textbackslash}par Recommendations: Rather than attempting to develop and support the analytical skills required to maintain and update CSP–3 inspection algorithms and data-mining activities, the pathway manager should seek support from a provider such as ABARES. Use CSP for risk-based management of all consignments entering under the dates tariff, whether fresh or dried, splitting the pathway by importer. For other pathways being assessed for CSP, DAFF should consider splitting the pathways by importer. Continue data-mining activities on fruit inspection data (presently underway as ACERA Project 1206F). Improve border data capture of permit data for PBS.},

The potential for these methods to serve effectively in a biosecurity setting is evaluated. {\textbackslash}par The most appropriate tools and methods for characterising the impacts of invasive pests and diseases are identified from the sets available. Their strengths and weaknesses are discussed, and examples are provided of their applications. {\textbackslash}par The report develops specific approaches for assessing primary production, social and environmental impacts and describes them in detail. The methods include: A partial equilibrium economic model coupled to a simple biological spread model applicable to a broad range of pests and diseases; The use of constructed scales to encapsulate a range of social, cultural and amenity values; The use of the probability of extinction as an appropriate measure of impact on biodiversity. Given the difficulty of estimating this aspect directly, a method is outlined for estimating an impact metric that may be applied to a broad range of native and culturally important species, and which provides a proxy measure of the probability of extinction. {\textbackslash}par The report also discusses situations where a broader general equilibrium analytical framework is appropriate and outlines what this approach would involve. It explores how the shapes of consequence curves can affect investment decisions, particularly in the longer term. {\textbackslash}par Due to the difficulty in servicing traditional economic impact simulation models with sufficient and accurate data, we suggest the need for a broader range of criteria on which to base biosecurity investment decisions. In particular, we advocate the use of quantitative models of prediction in conjunction with structured decision‐making techniques so that the full extent of market and non‐ market invasion consequences can be appreciated by decision makers.},

The purpose of this report is to describe field tests of the tools, recommendations for modifications and developments to suit operational conditions, and (for case study ii) the test version of the software (Project Stage 5). {\textbackslash}par In summary, the two case studies explain: i. the use of EpiTools (a set of web-based tools) to create a survey strategy for demonstration of freedom from citrus canker in the Northern Territory; and ii. the use of an Excel-based eradograph-monitoring tool, to show progress towards regional extirpation of orange hawkweed in the Australian Alps.},

	abstract = {Scoring systems are commonly employed in risk analysis as a way of integrating information about a range of variables (called risk attributes) into a single risk score suitable for decision making. The construction of scoring systems is often criticised as being arbitrary as there is no transparent basis for the selection of weightings and integration methods. This paper describes an alternative approach which overcomes these difficulties. The method we detail is called Point of Truth Calibration. It is based on expert judgements on constructed risk scenarios rather than individual scores of risk attributes. We argue that it is an improved form of expert elicitation for many complex risk assessment problems. The proposed method will ‘automatically’ calibrate weightings (scores) of risk attributes from the overall risks given by experts using well developed statistical techniques. Several examples from biosecurity are presented to demonstrate the approach.},

	abstract = {This report considers ways of reconciling qualitative and quantitative import risk assessment methods. There is a current view within some quarters that the use of these approaches requires a choice, and that the use of one approach precludes the use of the other. This is explored in this report, and ways of constructing the analysis from a logical foundation is developed. {\textbackslash}par Both approaches have been used previously in setting biosecurity policy and both have strengths and weaknesses. {\textbackslash}par Qualitative analysis is by far the predominant technique for performing import risk analysis. What constitutes a qualitative analysis varies widely. The analysis typically breaks up the risk pathway into steps such as entry, establishment and spread and then assesses the likelihood of these steps in some way, consistent with relevant international standards. {\textbackslash}par The repeatability of qualitative analysis can be debated for a number of reasons. First, its use of loosely defined terms such as Low, Medium and High means that there is ambiguity in their meaning. Second, questions in the analysis are often vaguely defined so there can be significant ambiguity in their definition. Third, techniques to combine the components of the assessment to reach an overall conclusion are typically ad hoc and not based on rigorous analysis. {\textbackslash}par Quantitative analysis offers the potential for greater transparency and interpretability. Given this, the approach also adds significant technical overheads and challenges when data is sparse or not available. The transparency of the approach invites high degrees of scrutiny which can complicate debate. A simple model can often fail to represent a complicated pattern of trade, leading to significant problems. In responding to this, models can become too complicated. Thus the use of quantitative methods does not, in itself, guarantee an improved analysis. {\textbackslash}par In this report we develop a quantitative import risk assessment model that is structured equivalently to qualitative import risk assessment models. This means that it will consider the steps of entry, establishment and spread. While the model is quantitative, in the sense that beliefs are expressed numerically, it is anticipated that it will typically be populated by expert-based assessments. We produce clear definitions for the quantities we are eliciting from the experts to ensure that conclusions from the process are logical and well founded. The advantage of the proposed approach is that it will produce an assessment consistent with international standards while clearly communicating its logical basis. {\textbackslash}par To do this we first describe the risk assessment problem. This highlights the complexity of the task and the diverse range of issues that need to be considered in making an assessment. We then consider the mechanics of probabilistic modelling of this system. While many authors suggest the ad hoc use of probability distributions for dealing with uncertainty, they rarely address the issue holistically, assessing how the results of the analysis map to the real world problem we are considering. With our understanding of the problem and the probabilistic framework we have developed, we consider issues in defining a quantitative analysis. We explore the complications that arise in the context of import risk analysis and show why simple models with strong independence assumptions can fail. Building on this analysis, we consider how an analysis concentrating on entry, establishment and spread could be framed in a quantitative way, and use this to propose a possible set of questions that could form the basis of a compact and rigorous expert-based import risk assessment system. The results are then applied to a simple example. {\textbackslash}par This is not an academic exercise. Lack of consistency in application of policies because of different interpretations of questions adds an element of randomness to the decision making process. This is because the outcome of the process could depend on the individuals involved rather than the details of the particular case. Ambiguity in the process also opens up the possibility of manipulation by interested parties. If the meaning of questions is not transparent, parties can make assumptions about the meanings which favour the outcome they want. The ambiguity provides an element of confusion to the debate that can potentially cloud communication. Finally, a clear mathematical framework is the foundation of any logical analysis. By laying this foundation we will be able to successfully and logically integrate appropriate tools for issues such as uncertainty analysis and expert elicitation. Without this, ambiguity could be potentially the biggest source of uncertainty, nullifying any potential benefits of new techniques trying to improve the outcomes of the biosecurity system. {\textbackslash}par This report is targeted at technical scientists and policy makers within biosecurity agencies. It will hopefully contribute to the debate and thinking about future development of import risk assessment techniques.},

	url = {https://cebra.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0016/2221243/0904-final-report.pdf},
	abstract = {This report addresses several of the priorities identified during the first phase of this project relating to uncertainty in weed risk management systems by John Virtue (South Australian Dept. of Land, Water \& Conservation). In particular, it assesses the effect of uncertain knowledge on our ability to identify invasive plants using classification systems. The Australian Weed Risk Assessment (WRA) system uses information on a species' current weed status in other parts of the world, climate and environmental preferences, and biological attributes to predict whether it would be a serious weed (i.e. invasive) if introduced to Australia. Documented evidence of invasiveness elsewhere is considered the best predictor of being a weed in Australia, though such evidence is not always available or is uncertain. This report assesses how critical it is to know whether a species is invasive elsewhere when undertaking a weed risk assessment, and the implications when such information is unknown or uncertain. The results show that when knowledge of invasiveness elsewhere is unknown, the probability of being invasive is generally reduced. This suggests that there is indeed some information to assist with weed classification when a species' invasiveness elsewhere is unknown. The report also helps to quantify how much opportunity in terms of residence time would be considered sufficient for a species to demonstrate invasive potential. The report estimates that based on past introductions in temperate climes (e.g. woody perennials introduced to Brandenburg [Germany] and South Australia), at least a century of observation would be required before a woody perennial species could be declared incapable of becoming a major weed with any certainty. This time could probably be reduced substantially by experimental trials that fast-track the naturalisation process. Using the original data used to "train" the WRA system, though excluding information on documented invasiveness for a species introduced outside their native range, a classification model was built that performed well in identifying weeds, though poorly at identifying non-weeds. This contrasts somewhat with the previous belief that much of the classification ability of the current WRA system arises from information pertaining to a species' introduction record and invasive status elsewhere. The report identifies some challenges in assembling the data needed to reassess the current and proposed WRA systems.},

	abstract = {This is a review of a range of current risk assessment protocols for live organisms, condensed into an overriding set of themes. The themes, extracted from protocols, are evaluated using qualitative and quantitative data to elucidate the ranking of pest species on the basis of their invasive ability in Australia and are generally confined to assessing a single taxon. Five overall themes are fundamental to the majority of protocols: pathways of entry; establishment; potential distribution; impact in environmental, economic and social systems; and feasibility of management (including surveillance, detection and control). {\textbackslash}par The themes separated into two areas: the first being the probability and potential of the species to invade and spread in Australia; and, the second being the impact on the environment, economy or social systems. Pathways, establishment, potential distribution and feasibility of control can be effectively analysed using a Bayesian network approach. A generic framework for such an analysis was prepared and is included in this report. The impact of an invasive pest is best assessed using multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA). MCDA provides the opportunity to examine conflicting interests and objectives. The underlying trade-offs can be examined and the impact of alternate choices can be quantified in the final rankings. A set of parameters and measurement techniques for an MCDA, ranking the importance of invasive non-primary industry pests is proposed in this report. {\textbackslash}par A subset of the Weeds of National Significance list was used to assess the robustness of rankings within a single MCDA methodology. Different MCDA methodologies were examined using 11 different pests selected from the Northern Australia Quarantine Strategy pest lists. These pests were selected from different taxons to examine the feasibility of applying the MCDA framework across different taxa.

In absence of relevant data and contexts for Australian quarantine, the report uses data from New Zealand on inspections and detections. It introduces some common controlcharting techniques from manufacturing and veterinary epidemiology. It concludes that control charts are particularly well suited to visualising moderate to large volumes of time-based data such as would be expected in container inspection systems, and to detecting ‘unusual’ or ‘aberrant’ trends. Their utility for detecting the occurrence (in space) of an invasive species is more limited. For very low probability events, (eg. exotic disease outbreak) monitoring ‘time between outbreaks’ is a potentially more useful quantity, although the report shows that the statistical power (ability to correctly identify real ‘shifts’ in the mean time between events) of current charting techniques is relatively low. {\textbackslash}par The report provides examples and makes suggestions regarding how these tools might be tested more effectively.},

	abstract = {Risk-based biosecurity surveillance systems rely, amongst other things, on reliable spatial models of the potential habitat of species of concern, often termed species distribution models (SDMs). A SDM can be used for a variety of purposes: - By understanding the possible extent of an incursion it can underpin the estimation of the potential economic, environmental and human health costs. - By combining an SDM with pathway analysis it can assist in prioritizing where surveillance effort should be expended to maximise the likelihood of early detection. {\textbackslash}par An understanding of the potential habitats the species can establish in can support eradication campaigns. A challenge in developing SDM’s is the diversity of techniques and opinion in the scientific literature. No one modelling technique has emerged as being suitable for all applications. In addition, while the importance of basing models on good predictive variables is understood conceptually there has been little attempt to review this or develop concrete protocols to identify these variables. {\textbackslash}par This project reviews the available environmental data and explores the information in the literature defining proximal variables, which are variables that are most directly and closely linked to the biological process and therefore likely to be the best predictors of potential distribution. The review identified that there is not a consistent approach within ecology to identifying proximal variables. While proximal variables are well defined conceptually, identifying them from observations of the species is more complex, because correlation can obscure causation. In other words, it is difficult to measure promixity. Thus while a variable may appear strongly predictive, its performance in other locations cannot be unambiguously predicted. {\textbackslash}par Based on this review the project then explored several approaches to developing predictive models. We developed methods to try to identify proximal variables statistically using small two variable models to guard against over-fitting. We also tested new microclimatic variables with a more physiological basis than those commonly used. Once variables were selected, we then tested a range of methods for making predictions to new regions, including (1) from a fitted model, (2) from climate envelopes constructed on the selected variables. The reason for the latter is that there are a number of compelling reasons that probability based predictions to new regions will be unreliable. These methods where then applied to five case studies using pests that have or could establish in Australia and/or New Zealand. There was no clear preferred approach from this analysis. {\textbackslash}par The basis of this result was explored via simulation analysis. This analysis demonstrated that variables could be strongly predictive in the native range but weakly predictive when projected to new locations. This demonstrated a fundamental limitation in our ability to accurately perform these projections with any of the tested models. {\textbackslash}par Based on these analyses a protocol was developed that reflects this inherent uncertainty. This protocol recommends experts based assessment of proximal variables and incorporation of this uncertainty into the analysis. It recommends the use of envelopes rather than probability methods when projecting to new locations.},

	abstract = {Many different plant-based products are imported into Australia. Some of these products may present a biosecurity risk to Australia because they contain biosecurity risk material (BRM; insects, pathogens, contamination, etc). Hence, these products are subjected to various quarantine interventions, ranging from documentary assessments to mandatory on-arrival inspections. These interventions are designed to reduce the likelihood of entry of BRM that could have undesirable impacts in Australia. {\textbackslash}par Imports are managed by considering plant import “pathways”. Pathways are defined by the Department of Agriculture (DA) pathway manager, and can be any grouping of imported products, for example “raisins”. Grouping may also relate to things like individual importers, or countries of origin. The overall biosecurity risk presented by a plant import pathway is determined by the likelihood of arrival of BRM in an import, and the severity of possible impact of that BRM. Current intervention strategies do not necessarily reflect this risk, and the department is changing pathway management strategies as part of the biosecurity reform agenda arising from the Beale review [1]. The current biosecurity reform process includes the implementation of a risk-based approach to biosecurity, to minimise the risk to Australia for a given level of investment (risk-return). Moving resources from areas where risk is relatively low and focusing these resources in areas where more substantial reductions in risk could be achieved, would contribute to this. In this report we extend earlier ACERA work [2, 3] and focus on two broad areas designed to deal more appropriately with biosecurity risk, namely Continuous Sampling Plans (CSPs; described below) and data mining. {\textbackslash}par Broadly speaking the project comprised four themes: (i) comparison of CSP alternatives using a new criterion, namely “inspections per detection” (IPD: the average number of import inspections carried out to detect an import containing BRM), and more explicit consideration of existing criteria such as leakage (leakage refers to the number of imports containing BRM missed over some time period of interest, hence entering the post-border area of Australia); (ii) the implications of applying a CSP to manage a “combined” pathway (e.g. “nuts”) as opposed to component pathways (e.g. almonds, cashews, walnuts, etc); (iii) investigating the role of data mining for identifying high-risk components of pathways; and (iv) using and building on internal capacity within the department (ABARES) to facilitate the uptake of the outcomes of this work. {\textbackslash}par Criteria for assessing a Continuous Sampling Plan CSPs monitor pathways by switching between modes of random inspection, where a proportion of imports are inspected, and enhanced inspection, where a consecutive number of imports are inspected. These are referred to as CSP rates. Switching between modes depends on the outcomes from recent inspections of imports on a pathway. CSPs are being considered as a way of monitoring low-risk pathways that have a low proportion of imports containing BRM, and where the BRM on the pathway is not likely to have severe impact, either because of the material itself, or because of the post-entry use of the product in Australia. Earlier work by ACERA indicated that if a pathway was stratified by suppliers (for example), with a CSP applied independently to each individual supplier (but using the same CSP rates for each one), then with the same overall effort more BRM could be detected using a CSP compared with just random sampling of each supplier. {\textbackslash}par Different CSP rates and different stratifications (e.g. importers, suppliers) produce different overall inspection outcomes. Earlier work focussed on Post Intervention Compliance (PIC; the proportion of consignments that are compliant after applying an inspection regime) as the main performance/selection criterion for pathway managers to use when deciding which rates to adopt. In this report we focus more attention on absolute leakage, which is determined jointly by compliance rate (the proportion of imports that don’t contain BRM) and pathway volume (the number of imports over some time period of interest). Absolute leakage better reflects biosecurity risk to Australia. Once a level of acceptable absolute leakage is chosen (say for example 3 BRM in a year on a particular pathway), IPD can be used to determine the most efficient inspection strategy to achieve this level of leakage. This is consistent with the new risk-return approach in the department. {\textbackslash}par The different pathways analysed in this report present different tradeoffs in IPD and leakage. Some show little variation in leakage as a function of different CSP rates, but substantial variation in IPD, meaning that substantial reductions in IPD can be achieved without a large increase in leakage. In contrast, others show substantial variation in leakage with limited variation in IPD, making the decision on CSP rates more difficult. Determining the preferred strategy for any particular pathway will require analysis of that pathway. We provide a full set of tables and associated figures for each pathway considered in this report (raisins, cashews, dried apricots, green coffee beans, hulled sesame seeds, and dried dates) so that pathway managers can consider the potential tradeoffs between different CSP designs. {\textbackslash}par Applying a CSP to a combined pathway To date, CSPs have been applied to component pathways, but there may be administrative and resourcing benefits of applying them to combined pathways. In this report we explore the implications of combining pathways for the CSP selection criteria used to determine CSP sampling rates (enhanced and random inspection rates). If CSPs are being considered for a combined pathway, then all component pathways should satisfy the definition of low risk given above. In this report we analyse the “nut” pathway as an example, but point out that the decision about whether component pathways for nuts are low risk has not been made at this stage. {\textbackslash}par In this example case, the analysis showed that treating nuts as one pathway for both estimating and applying CSP rates produced the lowest IPD, but at the expense of higher leakage, compared with choosing and applying rates for the lowest IPD for each individual pathway. This approach needs to be investigated further with other pathways, and consideration should be given to other pros and cons of combining pathways, as opposed to treating them separately, when considering the operational usefulness of this approach. For example, we may ask: are failure types likely to be specific to individual nut types? in which case perhaps they should be separated. {\textbackslash}par Data mining to identify factors associated with risk In past projects data mining has been used to identify pathways that may be suitable for CSP monitoring, for example, those with low proportions of BRM. Alternatively, data mining could be used to identify factors associated with higher risk on a pathway. It could be used for example to focus inspection effort on a pathway as one way to improve inspection effectiveness (the ability of an individual inspection to find BRM). In this project we applied to the nut data a new data mining method called group OSCAR, and an existing method known as random forests, as a trial of data mining methods for plant import data. The data mining was constrained by our computer infrastructure (see below), but results suggested that nut type (almond, cashew, etc) was not a strong predictor of risk, relative to the higher risk associated with suppliers, importers or countries. Higher risk importers/suppliers/countries tended to have low numbers of imports. These types of importers/suppliers/countries would be detected by the initial enhanced inspection applied in a CSP, depending on what stratification the CSP was focussed on. Future work on data mining would benefit from considering pathways with higher proportions of BRM, and a broader range of potential pathway attributes that could be associated with BRM. {\textbackslash}par Building and using capacity with the department This project built a strong collaboration between ACERA, the quantitative sciences section in ABARES (DA), and Plant Import Operations, Plant Biosecurity Division (DA). Capacity to carry out future CSP and data mining analyses has been developed in the department, and the research outcomes from the project have been enhanced by including scientists from the department directly in the research and analysis. This approach provides one model for improving both the uptake and outcomes of research and development. {\textbackslash}par Other issues The CSP rates are chosen based on simulation of data that comes from mandatory inspection of a pathway, hence simulated performance assumes the pathway continues to behave in a similar way. Once a CSP is implemented, the inspection history will come from the subset of the import pathway inspected according to the CSP rules and rates applied to the pathway. It is essential that methods are developed to determine (i) whether the proportion of BRM on the pathway deviates from the original data; (ii) how long it takes to detect deviation and the implications that has for risk; and (iii) how CSP rates can be updated to reflect changes in the proportion of BRM on a pathway. Future work should address these questions. {\textbackslash}par Computer hardware and software available for this project limited some of the analyses. Data mining in particular was constrained by this, but the CSP computer simulation would also benefit if its speed could be increased.},

	abstract = {This report looks at two important dimensions to the characterization of consequences in the context of biosecurity decision-support. {\textbackslash}par Part A explores time preference. Pests vary in the time over which their impacts are realized. Likewise, stakeholders vary in the time horizons they consider relevant to biosecurity concerns. Agricultural impacts might reasonably be considered over 30 years. Ecologists typically consider environmental impacts over much longer time frames. Part A addresses: The conceptual relevance of time preference to biosecurity using monetary benefits and costs associated with the decision of whether or not to invest in preventing invasion of a weed. How time preference has been approached in case studies reported in the literature, focussing on contrasts between decision support approaches based on conventional benefit-cost analyses versus those that use a multi-attribute approach. The literature highlights the failure of multi-criteria approaches to address time preference. An empirical study that elicited time preferences from biosecurity experts and managers for market and non-market-impacts. Problems in dealing with time preference using multi-attribute decision support and a remedy based on normative understanding of weights and their role in articulating trade-offs. {\textbackslash}par Part B demonstrates the relevance of the economic concept of ‗value of information‘(VOI), and how biosecurity managers can use VOI analysis to decide whether or not to reduce uncertainty by collecting additional information through monitoring, experimentation, or some other form of research. It explores: How some uncertainties may be scientifically interesting to resolve, but ultimately irrelevant to decision-making. VOI analysis provides a rigorous way of assessing the benefits of collecting additional information, and determining whether reducing uncertainty will result in a better decision. A prototype model where a manager must choose between eradication or containment of an infestation. Eradication is more cost-effective for smaller infestations, but once the extent reaches a certain size it becomes more cost-effective to contain. When choosing between eradication and containment, how much does knowing the extent of the infestation more exactly improve the outcome of the decision? We calculate the expected value of perfect information (EVPI) about the extent, which provides an upper limit for the value of reducing uncertainty. We then illustrate the approach using the example of red imported fire ant management in south-east Queensland. We calculate the EVPI for three different uncertain variables: the extent of the infestation, the sensitivity (true positive rate) of remote sensing, and the efficacy of baiting. This case study is an illustration only, although with further work it could be developed into a useful support tool. Future avenues for research in this area include modelling the time delay associated with research and monitoring, and applying more complex VOI calculations such as the expected value of partial information and the expected value of sample information.},

	abstract = {Background: DAFF is moving towards a risk-based approach to managing the biosecurity risk of various pathways. DAFF requires and issues an import permit for the importation of certain bulk products, for example, medium-risk plant-based stockfeed (PBS). An audit is undertaken of the importing company before an import permit can be permitted. The audits are of varying intensity, ranging from desk audits to site visits. In a risk-based intervention setting, the outcomes of audits might be useful for targeting border inspection efforts, and the results of border inspections could be used to guide audit frequency. {\textbackslash}par Overview: The goal of this study was to determine what the effect is of border inspection outcomes upon audit outcomes and the effect of the outcomes of audits on border inspection results, for PBS. In other words, the goal was to ask whether there is a feedback loop between offshore and border risk mitigation strategies. {\textbackslash}par The goal could not be achieved: the inspection outcomes could not be reliably linked to the audit data due to incomplete data capture at the border; the import permit number was commonly omitted or misrecorded. The project scope was changed to comprise an assessment of a proposed off-shore sampling regime (reported as Outcome 2). {\textbackslash}par Outcomes: 1. With the current data holdings, data capture policies, and offshore risk management strategies in place, connecting the outcomes of audits and border inspections in such a way that statistically reliable information can be obtained is a prohibtively cumbersome task (p. 12). 2. Certified, third-party offshore sampling of bulk-shipped PBS is safer and more efficient than the within-QAP bulk inspection (p. 22).},

	abstract = {Disease managers face many challenges when deciding on the most effective control strategy to manage an outbreak of foot and mouth disease (FMD). Decisions have to be made under conditions of uncertainty and where the situation is continually evolving. In addition, resources for control are often limited. A modelling study was carried out to identify characteristics measurable during the early phase of a FMD outbreak that might be useful as predictors of the total number of infected places, outbreak duration and the total area under control. {\textbackslash}par The study involved two modelling platforms in two countries (Australia and New Zealand) and encompassed a large number of incursion scenarios. Linear regression, classification and regression tree and boosted regression tree analyses were used to quantify the predictive value of a set of parameters on three outcome variables of interest: the total number of infected places, outbreak duration and the total area under control. The number of infected premises, number of pending culls, area under control, estimated dissemination ratio, and cattle density around the index herd at days 7, 14 and 21 following first detection were associated with each of the outcome variables. Regression models for the size of the area under control had the highest predictive value (R2 = 0.51 - 0.9) followed by the number of infected premises (R2 = 0.3 - 0.75) and outbreak duration (R2 = 0.28 - 0.57). Predictability improved at later time points in the outbreak. Predictive regression models using various cut-points at day 14 to define small and large outbreaks had positive predictive values of 0.85 - 0.98 and negative predictive values of 0.52 - 0.91, with 79\% to 97\% of outbreaks correctly classified. On the strict assumption that each of the simulation models used in this study provide a realistic indication of the spread of FMD in animal populations we conclude that relatively simple metrics available early in a control program can be used to indicate the likely magnitude of an FMD outbreak under Australian and New Zealand conditions.},

	url = {https://cebra.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/2383453/1301C-Final-Report.pdf},
	abstract = {To estimate and manage the likelihood of transferring marine pests within Australia, CSIRO and the Department of Agriculture (formerly the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) developed the Australian ballast water risk assessment (hereafter called the BWRA). The original system was endorsed by the National Introduced Marine Pests Coordination Group. Current decisions on the system are now made by the Marine Pest Sectoral Committee (MPSC). {\textbackslash}par The BWRA is a modular, species-specific system that estimates the likelihood that a species could be taken up from one Australian port, transported to another Australian port and successfully complete its lifecycle there, for any given month in the year. The intent of the system is that when likelihood of a successful transfer is high, the vessel needs to exchange its ballast water before arriving in the recipient port. Currently 129 ports and seven species (Asterias amurensis - Northern Pacific Seastar, Carcinus maenas - European Green Crab, Varicorbula gibba - European Clam, Musculista senhousia - Asian Date or Bag Mussel, Sabella spallanzani - European Featherduster Worm, Undaria pinnatifida - Japanese Seaweed or Wakame, and Crassostrea gigas - Pacific Oyster) are considered in the system. {\textbackslash}par The original version of the BWRA was constructed using a combination of code written for the open-source statistical environment R and Visual Basic in Microsoft Excel. The process was unnecessarily complicated by the need to move repeatedly between these two programs, and made code maintenance potentially difficult or expensive. In addition, the temperature tolerances for the species life-stages were embedded within the R code, which made updating difficult. {\textbackslash}par In a recent ACERA project (1004E), the table construction process was updated to allow the entire analytical process to occur within R. Microsoft Excel is now used only for the storage of input data and results. The code was modified to allow temperature tolerance data for the species of concern to be stored in an Excel worksheet, instead of being ‘hard-wired’ within the R code, and hence relatively inaccessible. The table generation process was further modularised for ease of use, and to allow risk tables to be updated without necessarily running full code within each module. During that project some problems with the underlying methodology for module D were identified, which have implications for estimating likelihood. In this project we explore these problems and identify solutions. {\textbackslash}par A critical component of the risk assessment is estimating whether species are likely to be able to complete their lifecycle if introduced to a port by (1) simulating progression through lifecycles for select ports in response to sea (and in some cases air) temperatures, where SeaFRAME (Sea level Fine Resolution Acoustic Measuring Equipment) temperature data are available; and (2) using the results from the simulation models to develop statistical models that relate lifecycle completion to latitude, and then using the statistical models to predict lifecycle completion for the other ports. In the recent project problems were identified with the generation of synthetic air and sea temperature data (derived from SeaFRAME data), and with the interpretation of risk from the species lifecycle simulations. {\textbackslash}par Generating synthetic air and sea temperature data In the original version of the BWRA, sea temperature simulations were generated in such a way that substantially different estimates of lifecycle completion for species introduced on 31 December vs. 1 January could occur, which is clearly unreasonable. The original approach also had limitations when considering between-year variation in sea temperatures. To address this we used a technique known as a block bootstrap, with time series constructed by randomly selecting from the yearly blocks with replacement. We modelled the minimum daily temperature and the difference between the minimum and maximum daily temperature, with the maximum daily temperature simulated based on the simulated minimums plus the simulated differences. This ensures that maximum daily temperature is always greater than the minimum daily temperature. This approach ensures that year to year variation in temperatures is included in the simulations and that lifecycle simulation outcomes are similar for introductions on 31 December vs. 1 January. {\textbackslash}par Estimating likelihood from lifecycle models In the original version of the BWRA, likelihood of survival was based on a species completing on average 80\% of its lifecycle, given introduction in a particular month. It was argued that this cutoff reflected a good tradeoff between the “comfort and environmental protection provided by a low level, against the benefits and better risk resolution provided by a high level.” Put another way, the argument was that if a species completes on average less than 80\% of its lifecycle, then the likelihood of survival is low because it’s not getting close to the end of its lifecycle. However, there is more that one way this average can result from simulations. From 1000 simulations an 80\% average could be obtained because all the simulations give a percentage lifecycle completed of around 80\%, or it could be obtained because in 800 simulations the species completes all of its lifecycle and in 200 simulations it completes none of its lifecycle. This type of result was common for many of the species’ lifecycle simulations. The interpretation of likelihood from these two different scenarios is completely different, despite the fact the mean proportion of lifecycle completed is the same. In the latter case, using the mean, we would be concluding that a species that completed all of its lifecycle in 800 of 1000 simulations was on the border of being considered low likelihood; this is clearly not the case. {\textbackslash}par To address this, the MPSC has agreed to use as a criterion the proportion of simulations for which 100\% of the lifecycle is completed. This still requires a cutoff above which survival is considered ‘likely’. In the absence of detailed empirical information on what this cutoff should be, the decision at present is to use a 0.05 cutoff and to covert the metric to a monthly value by assuming that if the proportion of simulations on any day within a month exceeds 0.05, then that month will be considered risky for survival of the pest should it arrive. While other processes contribute to the probability of establishment, lifecycle completion is taken as a risk-averse proxy for establishment in the absence of any good quantitative evidence for the magnitude of effect of these other processes. For many species/port combinations, the new method increases the number of months in which lifecycle completion is considered likely. In this report we show the implications of choosing this cutoff for each simulated port and compare this with the old rule. {\textbackslash}par Future developments It can be questioned whether it is appropriate to generalise lifecycle completion results to ports where sea surface temperature data are not available based on results at the 13 ports with SeaFRAME data. Generalising against latitude has obvious problems because it can only reliably describe very broad patterns in sea surface temperature; it does not take into account local conditions or ocean currents, which differ for example between the east and west coasts. One approach to address these problems would be to use satellite-derived sea surface temperature data as the raw data for simulation modelling at every port, removing the need to generalise using just latitude. These data would also provide more insights into the spatial variation in temperature throughout a port. {\textbackslash}par Any cutoff based solely on the lifecycle simulations would be arbitrary, but fits with the decision being made because decisions apply to the arrival of individual vessels. However, the probability a pest will establish in a port over a given time period is actually determined by probability of establishment given arrival (from one vessel), in combination with the number of journeys carrying the pest arriving over that time period. Cutoffs could be developed that take account of the number of transits between ports. {\textbackslash}par Recommendations We recommend that the Department of Agriculture: • Notes that the MPSC has endorsed the new method for generating sea surface temperatures. • Notes that the MPSC has endorsed defining the monthly yes/no decision point for acceptable risk of introduction to: full lifecycle being completed in 5\% of simulations on any day in a month. • Considers developing a method based on satellite-derived sea surface temperature data to generate data for simulation modelling at every port. • Considers developing a method for determine a risk cutoff that incorporates the number of transits between ports.},

	abstract = {Although there is evidence that passive surveillance services provided by the public can be very valuable (in terms of both reduced program costs and increased probability of success in managing pests) little is known about the return on investment for this type of expenditure. {\textbackslash}par Enabling passive surveillance requires community information campaigns and incentive schemes. This takes funds away from other activities, so it is important to estimate the value of these campaigns relative to other alternatives, such as increasing active (structured) surveillance. {\textbackslash}par This project contributes towards an understanding of the value of passive surveillance provided by members of the community using a case study: the red imported fire ant (RIFA) eradication program in Brisbane. The RIFA program, managed by Biosecurity Queensland Control Centre (BQCC), is well documented. BQCC has an intense public awareness program with multiple activities, including broad and targeted coverage of distinct community groups and zones within the Brisbane area. We have combined data on community engagement events, reports from the public and nest detections recorded by BQCC, with census data to estimate relationships between demographic characteristics of an area and the likelihood that residents from that area will report encounters with RIFA. {\textbackslash}par In this report we present background information and hypotheses regarding the role of community surveillance in the management of biological invasions. This is followed by details of the datasets used and results of a number of analyses. We show the importance of the data clean-up process and identify the limitations that arise when a database designed primarily to track public reports is used for spatiotemporal analyses where accurate dating of events is important. {\textbackslash}par We also estimate the return on investment in community engagement in terms of the savings in structured-search costs it brings. This estimate uses probability maps to calculate the amount of active search that would have been required to detect all the known ant colonies in the period 2006-2010 if passive surveillance would not have been available. Assuming active search costs \$400/ha we obtain a value of \$52 million return per \$1 million invested in community engagement.},

It is now accepted that early detection of invasive weeds is essential for their effective management. Designing monitoring and survey processes aimed at detecting new incursions of invasive weeds requires an understanding of the detectability of the targeted weed species. To date, weed detectability has been investigated mainly in the context of determining the interval between surveys. Here, we discuss weed detection in the context of designing optimal surveillance strategies. {\textbackslash}par This project aims to develop a collaboration between the Australian Centre of Excellence in Risk Analysis, Applied Environmental Decision Analysis and Northern Australian Quarantine Strategy practitioners aimed at incorporating new developments in optimal surveillance into NAQS activities and investigating options for addressing the uncertainty attributed to imperfect detectability where it exists. This report represents the first stage in the development of optimal survey methods under NAQS. Here we provide a brief review of issues associated with the design of optimal survey strategies, focussing on the problem of imperfect detectability. We review methods for data collection and estimation of detectability rates and provide two case studies that detail data collection and state-of-the-art modelling of detection rates for grassland species. Models of detection time are presented for two highly invasive Nassella species, as is a new trait-based model of plant detection time that may be used to provide estimates of detectability where no species-specific detection model exists.

The report represents the outcomes of the first phase of a multi-year project designed to develop a rigorous method that can be used repeatedly to evaluate the health of the national biosecurity system against agreed performance criteria using appropriate performance indicators. The report was prepared for the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources (the department) but has relevance to all participants in the national biosecurity system. {\textbackslash}par The department currently relies largely on qualitative pathway-specific risk analyses and reviews to assess and address potentially unacceptable exposures to biosecurity risk. These analyses and reviews focus mainly on elements of the biosecurity system for which the Australian government has responsibility. However, the department does not currently have a means of estimating the health of the national biosecurity system as a whole against appropriate performance criteria This is a significant business gap that limits the capacity of the department to evaluate the effectiveness of its investments across the biosecurity system. Other participants, such as state and territory governments, are equally constrained in assessing the role they play in meeting the objectives of the overarching biosecurity system. {\textbackslash}par The report summarises progress to date on the project. It uses a program logic model to describe the key elements of the national biosecurity system, including the activities undertaken in the system by different participants, the resources to support them, the outputs that are produced by these activities and the outcomes they generate. The report also identifies the broad attributes of health against which the biosecurity system will be evaluated. These recognise that the national biosecurity system should be capable of meeting its objectives in an effective, efficient, robust, resilient and sustainable manner. {\textbackslash}par A case study is used in the report to measure aspects of biosecurity health against the framework. The case study is focused on some activities in the biosecurity system that are designed to prevent biosecurity risk material from entering the country on the air passenger pathway. The case study provides insights into the challenges and opportunities that will arise from the measurement of national biosecurity system health. It also explores the accessibility of data necessary to underpin effective performance evaluation and identifies gaps in current data availability. {\textbackslash}par The capacity to articulate the health of the national biosecurity system in clear terms against appropriate criteria provides a sound basis on which all participants can identify where system improvements can be made, either individually or on a collective, system-wide basis.},

In the time period covered by the data that were available to us, slightly less than half of fresh garlic consignments were fumigated offshore. Offshore fumigation reduced the contamination rate of live insects by about 59\%, compared with consignments that were not fumigated. Similarly, for orange imports, offshore fumigation reduced the contamination rate by about 67\%. Whilst the reductions in contamination rates were relatively high, it appears that the offshore treatments on these two pathways were not able to reduce the phytosanitory risks to acceptable levels: the contamination rates for those offshore treated fresh garlic and orange imports were about 9\% and 34\%, respectively. {\textbackslash}par For inspection data of consignments of fresh garlic that had been treated offshore, analysis with a Bayesian logistic model suggested that varying the concentration of methyl bromide applied did not result in statistically significant differences in contamination rates. Our analysis also suggested that there were no statistically significant differences between the outcomes of treatments provided by the fumigation providers. {\textbackslash}par A major bottleneck to analysis was the lack of available data in a computer accessible format. Some of the difficulties uncovered were: • The lack of a clear and direct link between department databases; • The storage of critical control point information in formats not amenable to numerical analysis (e.g., scanned phytosanitary certificates); and • The difficulty in deciphering the provenance of some quarantine directives. For example, it was sometimes unclear whether fumigation was performed because insect contamination had been detected or because of a mandatory fumigation requirement. {\textbackslash}par These issues were exemplified in the case study on the import of (fresh and dried) coconuts, within which incorrect conclusions from analyses could be made primarily because of data provenance issues. {\textbackslash}par The timing of fumigation directions and treatments was clarified in the case studies on imports of fresh garlic and oranges. However, the analysis was time-consuming due to the requirement to manually extract information from phytosanitary certificates before analysis. Furthermore, many phytosanitary certificates were illegible, an issue for both this analysis and for any back-tracing that may be required for investigation. {\textbackslash}par This report provides material evidence that obtaining the data to help manage biosecurity risk will be simplified and improved by linking the department’s databases. Furthermore, control-point data, especially phytosanitary certificates, should be captured electronically in a consistent database format, for the purposes of better understanding the impacts of critical control points of an import pathway.},

	abstract = {This report forms part of the evidence base to support the Commonwealth Government Department of Agriculture and Water Resources (the department) in reforming the design and implementation of Australia’s regulatory framework for biosecurity assurance. It builds on the findings of CEBRA Project 1304C: Incentives for Importer Choices (Rossiter et al., 2016), which developed proposals for regulatory frameworks that could provide appropriate incentives for participants to reduce the likelihood of biosecurity risk material entering Australia. CEBRA Project 1404C tests the appropriateness of candidate mechanisms and scopes alternative approaches to the way they are implemented using a series of economic experiments conducted with university students in a computer laboratory. {\textbackslash}par Much of the department’s focus on resource allocation in the context of biosecurity risk management, including the Risk-Return Resource Allocation model, does not formally incorporate or model the likely response of stakeholders (e.g. importers and suppliers) to changes in biosecurity control strategies employed by the department. Recent investigations in Rossiter et al. (2016) and Rossiter and Hester (2017), however, highlight that departmental assessments of biosecurity control strategies need to take these behavioural responses into account. This is because, under some circumstances, the incentive structures inherent in certain processes and strategies could encourage stakeholders to behave very differently under new protocols, relative to the established ones. {\textbackslash}par Imposing regulatory changes without carefully considering stakeholder responses could introduce inappropriate incentive structures for compliance and deliver unintended policy consequences, potentially undermining the maintenance of Australia’s high biosecurity status. In this context, the experiments conducted in this project are novel because their focus is on the behaviour of stakeholders, namely importers, in response to different protocols applied by a biosecurity regulator. In turn, this provides a complementary, but distinct, approach to guide how trade-offs associated with meeting the department’s biosecurity policy objectives could be managed. {\textbackslash}par This report documents the design and results from the experiments, where experimental subjects (students) assumed the role of importers and were required to make choices about their supplier over time. The experiments sought to mimic the interactions between the department and importers relating to biosecurity inspections. Rather than testing all aspects of importer decision-making under different candidate rules, the experiments examined particular aspects of the rules likely to be more difficult to assess in the field. The experimental treatments tested were constructed to inform the department about implementing compliance-based protocols and identify how current practices may be fine-tuned to better support departmental objectives. {\textbackslash}par The project investigated how the following aspects affect an importer’s choice of supplier: i. different inspection rules from the continuous sampling plan (CSP) family; ii. the level of information provided to stakeholders about the inspection rule; iii. feedback on an importer’s performance under the inspection rule; iv. costs of being inspected and of failing inspection; v. allowing rule-choice from a limited set of options; and vi. an importer’s understanding of the rule.},

	abstract = {The Stage 1 prototype exposure model was designed to investigate the value of a Bayesian network (BN) based approach to estimating the probability of pest entry and exposures across New Zealand. It proved that the approach was practical and that it was able to capture our understanding of how pests enter the country. The Stage 2 model builds on the successful earlier model by expanding and improving it in a variety of ways. In addition, custom software (called Spear) has been created to run and manage the model and its associated results. {\textbackslash}par The Stage 1 model focussed on three main types of pest – Asian gypsy moth (AGM), woodboring and bark beetles (WBB) and Phytophthora – along with a host of associated items (such as containers, vehicles, sea vessels and passengers). We added two new pest classes – pine shoot moth (PSM) and Fusarium – which is less than the six new pests originally envisioned. After substantial consultation, we concluded that these five pests provide excellent coverage of the features of pests that may enter, and hence additional pest models were not needed. This gave us more time for other work, including elicitation, sensitivity analysis and Spear. {\textbackslash}par Stage 2 includes a Generic pest submodel that can be used to represent any pest at a low level of detail. The Generic pest can be used to handle a range of possibilities including: unknown threat; poorly understood pests and pest classe; new pests that may not fit any of the existing model; or simplified versions of existing pest classes that benefit from a common structure. In addition to the Generic pest submodel, the database and software used to drive the model was re-architected to allow for a clean separation of pests and items, allowing any pest to be combined with any item by merely specifying the appropriate parameters. {\textbackslash}par We explored the value of incorporating monthly factors into the exposure model. This work, which focussed on the AGM, showed that taking into account monthly factors does add value to the models, and has been extended to other pest submodels where those pests are influenced in important ways by seasonal factors. It also suggests there may be benefits in running the exposure model at a monthly resolution by default for certain pests. {\textbackslash}par Many improvements have been made to the parameters used in Stage 1. Most of the changes have been driven by elicitation workshops with experts and other individuals that have good familiarity with the domain. A modified version of the Delphi technique was used to elicit values for parameters such as infestation rates, detection rates and a range of pest- and item-specific parameters. While such parameters are always subject to large amounts of uncertainty, most of the parameters in the model are now well supported by data, literature or elicited estimates. {\textbackslash}par A substantial start has been made on performing a sensitivity analysis of the exposure models. Sensitivity analysis is critical to understanding the robustness of a model and to assessing how uncertainty impacts the conclusions we might draw. While time did not allow for a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of the full system, we have conducted analyses of several of the system’s key submodels. The results were insightful and influenced model development. They also highlighted key factors for which good estimates were required (such as the time spent by items and their pests at various locations), and other factors that were less important. {\textbackslash}par At a broad level, the resulting exposure maps appear reasonable, and match well with the maps produced by the original prototype exposure model. The results for AGM on the used vehicles pathway match very well with the results produced in Stage 1, and this is as expected given the robustness of that model. The maps for Phytophthora fare less well, but this was also expected due to the lack of knowledge surrounding Phytophthora and the changes made to its model. {\textbackslash}par An important output of the project is the software created to run and manage the models. Many parts of the exposure model will need to change over time. For example, the number of items entering the country will grow or contract from year to year, land use and population densities will shift across the country, and the location of transitional facilities, shops and tourist sites will not always remain the same. For any given year, the model needs to be updated to take account of these changes, and exposure maps will need to be regenerated. The software automates the running of the exposure model, along with all of the tasks needed to generate exposure maps. This allows the model to remain relevant well into the future, without requiring any core changes. Importantly, the software also allows for exploratory runs, with methods for run management built in, and provides tools for aggregating pathways in a way that allows for a rudimentary overall risk analysis. {\textbackslash}par The following is a summary of the key outcomes of this project: The exposure model provides an explicit, transparent, flexible and robust representation of the nature of an entry pathway and its constituent pathway points; The model provides good coverage of the key classes of pests that may affect forest health; The model allows unknown or poorly understood pests to be modelled with a Generic pest; The model can take account of seasonal factors; The model and software contains a clean separation of items and pests, and there is now greater flexibility in how pests and items can be combined; Model parameters and data can be updated independently to create new exposure maps; The model and its software can be deployed as part of a surveillance workflow (through its user interface) and can also be embedded in other software directly; The Spear software has been created and is flexible enough to be used for both this and future biosecurity projects. {\textbackslash}par The following future work is recommended: Further improvements to the software, in particular to improve the automation of data updates, as well as to improve the tools available for analysing the model results; Extension of the model to handle pests that arrive by wind; Further sensitivity analysis work, including a full system sensitivity analysis if feasible; Further refinement of the (expert-based) parameters through future elicitation workshops; One or more published papers on the exposure model and its software; Software integration with the survey optimisation work; Extension of the full system (i.e., including exposure, establishment and survey optimisation) into a full risk model, that allows for a complete and proper risk assessment; Formal validation of the model, including comparisons against existing systems, such as MPI’s High-Risk Surveillance Sites (HRSS) system.},

	abstract = {The introduction of the Biosecurity Act (2015) means that as of 8 September 2017 when the act comes into force, all vessels, on both international and domestic voyages, will be required to manage their ballast water. To estimate and manage the likelihood of transferring marine pests within Australia, CSIRO and the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources (formerly the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) developed the Australian ballast water risk assessment (hereafter called the BWRA). The original system was endorsed by the National Introduced Marine Pests Coordination Group and updates have been endorsed by the Marine Pest Sectoral Committee (MPSC). {\textbackslash}par The BWRA is a modular, species-specific system that estimates the likelihood that a species could be taken up from one Australian port, transported to another Australian port and successfully complete its lifecycle there, for any given month in the year. The intent of the system is that when likelihood of a successful transfer is high, the vessel needs to manage its ballast water before arriving in the recipient port. Currently 129 ports and seven species (Asterias amurensis - northern Pacific seastar, Carcinus maenas - European green crab, Varicorbula gibba - European clam, Musculista senhousia - Asian date or bag mussel, Sabella spallanzani - European featherduster worm, Undaria pinnatifida - Japanese seaweed or wakame, and Crassostrea gigas - Pacific oyster) are the only species included in the system. {\textbackslash}par Life cycle simulation modelling A critical component of the BWRA is the simulation of species’ life cycles based on daily sea water temperature. The data underpinning these simulations are extracted from the Bureau of Meteorology’s (BoM) SeaFRAME (Sea level Fine Resolution Acoustic Measuring Equipment) tide gauge array for monitoring long period sea level changes. The array comprises 16 tide gauges, but data from only 13 are currently used in the BWRA. Statistical modelling of at least ten years of daily data is used to generate 1000 synthetic temperature time series for each SeaFRAME location and these are then used to simulate species lifecycles. One thousand synthetic temperature time series, combined with uncertainty in species temperature tolerances, lead to estimates of the proportion of simulations in which lifecycle is completed, for each of the target pest species in each of the SeaFRAME locations, given introduction to the location as larvae on each day of the year. For the risk tables these are then expressed as the proportion of simulations completed, given introduction in each month of the year. Life cycle completion for all the other ports in Australia is estimated from statistical models that relate simulated life cycle completion in tide gauge ports to latitude. In this report we investigate whether sea surface temperature data derived from satellites would be a better source of data than those from the tide gauges. {\textbackslash}par We found that the SeaFRAME tide gauge temperature data and satellite sea surface temperature (SST) data from the areas around the tide gauges were similar at most locations. Where the results differed, for example at Hilarys, a logical explanation was invariably possible, in this case that the location of the tide gauge inside an enclosed marina resulted in warmer temperatures in summer and cooler temperatures in winter due to reduced circulation and mixing with the open ocean, though this explanation has not been tested. The different data sets can produce different results for life cycle simulations when species temperature tolerances that underpin the life cycle models fall near the maximum or minimum water temperature recorded. It should be noted, though, that comparisons were only carried out for tide gauge locations. More substantial changes may be seen when the life cycle simulations that are currently extrapolated to distant ports using latitude as the analogue for temperature are replaced with satellite sea surface temperature (SST) data from the areas around the ports. {\textbackslash}par There is currently no understanding of which (if either) data source, properly captures the full range of temperatures experienced by marine species in any given port environment. Similarly, our understanding of the temperature tolerance ranges of invasive marine species and the effect of other factors such as salinity, disturbance and propagule pressure is far from complete. Both temperature data sources can probably be considered reasonable representations of the general temperatures experienced by marine species in ports. Both data sources have their advantages and disadvantages: the tide gauge data may be more accurate at the point at which it is recorded, but SST data may capture the range of temperatures in the environment around a port better. SST has a considerable advantage in that it covers the entire coastline, including in or near every port in Australia, which obviates the need to use the statistical models to interpolate lifecycle completion to the majority of ports based on latitude. On this basis, we recommend that SeaFRAME tide gauge temperature data be replaced with SST data as the data source for the BWRA risk tables. {\textbackslash}par Regardless of whether the BWRA is to adopt satellite SST as the data source underpinning the simulation models, the list of ports in the tables should be revised and reduced from the current 129 to a number that more accurately reflects the ports likely to receive discharged ballast water, including clusters of ports. If satellite SST data is adopted for the BWRA there are a number of technical issues regarding data access that will need to be resolved with the Department’s IT systems. {\textbackslash}par Vessel voyages and risk The current BWRA determines the risk of translocation for individual movements between one point and another, to determine whether ballast exchange is required. However, the overall risk of translocation is likely to incorporate the amount and type of traffic that undertakes particular voyages. We explore the use of vessel movement data for assessing the cumulative risk of establishment, and hence for identifying locations where resources would best be targeted for compliance and pest monitoring activities. {\textbackslash}par We found that Lloyds data are useful for determining how many voyages have occurred by vessels that could have been carrying bulk ballast water. However, the value of the data is limited because the data do not clearly identify whether any particular voyage was undertaken in ballast or with cargo. No data sets were identified that provide an easy and reliable way of determining this. In the future a more comprehensive data set that identifies the number of domestic voyages carrying large amounts of ballast water that requires discharge could be obtained from administration of the BWRA system. We recommend that any administrative system developed is designed to ensure comprehensive and accurate capture of these data. {\textbackslash}par Summary of recommendations • That SeaFRAME tide gauge temperature data be replaced with satellite sea surface temperature data as the data source for the BWRA risk tables. • That research be carried out to obtain empirical evidence that provides insight into how well the life cycle models represent actual risk. • That the list of ports be revised to remove those ports where ballast-water carrying vessels in the Type A category do not currently visit and to remove duplicates. • That the temperature tolerances of the species in the BWRA system be revised and updated. • That systems be developed to access sub-sets of SST data on IMOS’ system remotely using a protocol like OPeNDAP. • That systems be developed as part of the BWRA to capture data on domestic voyages carrying large amounts of ballast water requiring discharge.},

	abstract = {This report seeks to enhance the Department of Agriculture’s existing biofouling risk assessment tools, which have been developed to underpin a proposed regulatory approach to biofouling on vessels entering Australian waters. The Invasive Marine Species Programme is in the process of implementing new biofouling management arrangements, and a risk assessment system (the Marine Growth Risk Assessment or MGRA) has been developed to accompany these. The MGRA will operate alongside existing quarantine pre-arrival processes, and consider information about vessel biofouling management such as presence and age of antifouling coating, history of recent hull survey and marine growth inspection, evidence of seawater pipe work treatment, duration of stay in overseas locations, and duration in Australian ports and coastal waters. However it does not have the capacity to identify high risk pathways based on compatibility between Australian ports, the temperature and salinity tolerance and distribution of invasive marine species of concern and the last ports visited by internationally arriving vessels. Here, we report on a project seeking to improve existing risk assessment methods by undertaking expert elicitation on various incursion scenarios, and statistical analysis of outputs. {\textbackslash}par The project involved twenty nine national and international experts each rating the relative risk of twenty comparative scenarios. These ratings were used to construct a statistical model emulator summarising the expert’s views. The summary of these is as follows. {\textbackslash}par The estimated impact of anti-fouling coat condition on relative risk was large, as expected. Compared to a new anti-fouling coat, having anti-fouling at 50\% of its service life increased the risk by a factor of about 2. Similarly, compared to a new anti-fouling coat, having anti-fouling at 100\% of its service life increased the risk by a factor of approximately 4. {\textbackslash}par Moving from an enclosed river port to a coastal port lowered the estimated risk by 54\% compared to moving between either coastal ports or river ports. {\textbackslash}par The environmental similarity of ports was inferred to be an important cue by experts. Each degree increase in the absolute difference in mean sea surface temperature from the port of origin changed the relative risk by 0.923 (c. 8\% decrease). Similarly, each unit change in the absolute difference in mean water salinity from the port of origin altered the relative risk by 0.97 (a 3\% decrease). {\textbackslash}par Each additional day of berthing increased the relative risk by 1.033 (a 3.3\% increase). {\textbackslash}par There was no evidence that experts consistently factored in similarity in tidal range, or voyage duration, into their estimates. {\textbackslash}par The model emulator developed is well-suited to risk ranking applications. It cannot be applied to determine absolute risk and therefore, given a threshold, whether a journeys risk is acceptable or not. If there was a requirement to do this, further analysis using the marginal rate of introductions would be needed. Thus the model as it stands could directly support compliance targeting. To apply it to primary estimation of risk would require both additional analysis as well as work to integrate it logically with the MGRA tool.},

	abstract = {This report summarises the development of the on-arrival ornamental fish health monitoring system. The system is central to the Department of Agriculture (the department)’s ornamental fish import reform project, under which the department proposes to change the way it manages the biosecurity risks associated with the importation of ornamental fish into Australia. {\textbackslash}par The ACERA II 1206G Ornamental Finfish Import Reform Program developed a sampling framework and trial for the surveillance program that focused on trialing the operational feasibility of the monitoring system using non-compliant bags only (Phase 1). The data generated from Phase 1 testing are analysed in this report. Australian Import Management System (AIMS) data for all ornamental fish consignments for a 12 month period were analysed to provide a snapshot of activity for various pathways. A pathway is defined as all consignments in a particular risk group of fish imported by an importer and supplied by an exporter. The findings of these analyses are proved in this report. {\textbackslash}par This report also describes the proposed design of the next trial (Phase 2) of the fish health monitoring system. This trial has two components: A. Sampling, processing and testing of fish from compliant fish bags, i.e. bags of imported ornamental fish that on inspection are determined to be visually healthy. B. Sampling, processing and testing of fish from non-compliant fish bags, namely bags of imported ornamental fish that on inspection are determined to be associated with substantial signs of communicable disease. {\textbackslash}par For compliant bags, CEBRA proposes the use of sampling algorithm from the Continuous Sampling Plan (CSP) family. Similar algorithms have already been trialed for several imported plant-products. Each pathway is assigned to an ‘enhanced’ mode (a higher frequency of sampling) or ‘monitoring’ mode (a lower frequency of sampling), depending on the history of compliances of that pathway. The sampling framework will be effected through a dashboard, a spreadsheet-based program, developed by the department, which is linked to AIMS. The dashboard will automatically consider each imported consignment in the context of the pathway it represents and direct departmental officers to sample fish, based on a CSP algorithm specifically designed for ornamental fish. {\textbackslash}par For non-compliant bags, there is the need to develop definitions of non-compliance for inspectors, and a histological index that standardises the reporting of laboratories’ findings. This involves estimating disease levels associated with the occurrence of different kind of gross symptoms and histopathological observations. The main objective of this component of the monitoring system is to better identify emerging disease risks. CEBRA proposes to use an expert elicitation methodology to develop a definition of non-compliance and to develop the histological index. {\textbackslash}par It is recommended that the department and CEBRA continue to fine tune the fish monitoring system including the analysis of Phase 2 data, possibly expanding the scope of the trials and holding workshops to broaden the basis of the expert elicitations.},

	abstract = {1. The Australian Government Department of Agriculture and Water Resources has invested in the development of a disease simulation modelling capability, the Australian Animal Disease (AADIS) model, to support disease preparedness and response (Bradhurst et al. 2015). While AADIS was initially developed to simulate outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease there are a range of other disease threats it could be used for, including vector (insect) borne diseases. The aim of this project is to enhance AADIS to allow it to simulate the spread (and control) of vector-borne diseases of livestock such as bluetongue which is spread by Culicoides brevitarsis. {\textbackslash}par 2. This project combines a one-year CEBRA project with a three-year PhD research programme. The first year of the project, including the CEBRA component, focussed on development of: (a) the facility to import data from an external source into AADIS to represent vector abundance; and (b) the facility allowing users to estimate insect vector abundance directly within AADIS. Our intention here was to provide decision makers with flexibility. Simulation of vector distribution dynamics within AADIS will allow deployment of models to assist rapid decision making at the national level. Provision of a facility that permits the importation of spatial grids developed using third party statistical tools allows subject matter experts to develop (and then deploy) their own vector distribution models better suited to support decision making at finer spatial scales. A hypothetical vector with similar characteristics to C. brevitarsis was used as a case study for the AADIS vector module development. {\textbackslash}par 3. The C. brevitarsis distribution estimates developed external to AADIS were based on the published work of Kelso \& Milne (2014) with estimates of long distance dispersal of midges simulated using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model (Stein et al. 2015). {\textbackslash}par 4. The prototype AADIS vector module used the existing AADIS grid to represent the distribution of the hypothetical culicoides vector and a logistic growth equation to represent within-cell vector population dynamics. Jump and diffusion pathways were defined based on existing pathways in the AADIS agent-based model. The AADIS vector module was calibrated using data from the National Arbovirus Monitoring Programme. {\textbackslash}par 5. The following remaining tasks will be completed during the three year PhD programme: (a) verify and validate the AADIS vector module as a means for estimating insect vector abundance; (b) verify and validate the Kelso \& Milne (2014) HYSPLIT C. brevitarsis modelling approach described in this report; (c) provide guidelines for those developing vector abundance maps external to AADIS on how to numerically express vector abundance so that it is in a format suitable for use by AADIS; and (d) develop appropriate program logic to allow an infectious agent to spread within the vector population and to allow transfer of infection from the vector population to a livestock population at risk.},

	abstract = {Biosecurity agencies face challenging decisions of how best to allocate scare resources when they attempt to prevent, detect, eradicate and suppress exotic and established pests and diseases. In this regard, there is a key di↵erence between the value of biosecurity measures and the extra value, or value-added, of investments in biosecurity. The overall question, in other words, is not how valuable a given biosecurity measure (or set of measures) is, but how to allocate resources across di↵erent biosecurity measures and threats to get the best possible rate of return. {\textbackslash}par While resource allocation in biosecurity may be approached as a standard portfolio problem (Akter et al., 2015), allocating resources to address biosecurity threats may pose three additional challenges. First, policy makers are often faced with a (possibly large) number of pests, and each can be associated with a range of biosecurity measures, namely pre-border, border quarantine, post-border surveillance, and containment and eradication. A measure to control or prevent a particular pest likely influences the effectiveness of other measures, and the overall costeffectiveness of the money spent to address this problem. Consequently, a biosecurity portfolio must allocate a budget not only across di↵erent pests, but also across di↵erent measures to detect and control them. Second, invasive species are diverse in terms of how they spread, how they cause damage and how they are controlled, so evaluating cost-effectiveness across measures and species, as well as making them comparable, is complicated. Finally, apart from the biological and ecological stochasticity inherent in invasive species that can influence the outcome (Perrings 2005), a biosecurity portfolio must often be decided at early stages where information about many of the characteristics of the threats are very rough and scant. For this reason, biosecurity portfolio models ideally should not be overly demanding in the information required to calibrate them. {\textbackslash}par A proper portfolio allocation in biosecurity di↵ers from the common principle which ranks alternative projects by their benefit-cost ratios (Pearce et al., 2006) and picks the one that generates the highest benefit-to-cost ratio (BCR). This principle is sometimes referred to as ‘the winner takes all’ principle because the projects with highest average BCRs will be allocated at full scale while others may have no budget. This often results, however, in a misallocation of resources because the average BCR of a biosecurity project can be highly sensitive to its scale. Instead, it’s best to allocate each (small) block of budget to the treatment and measure that it is most cost-effective, and consequently determine the optimal scale of the control program for each threat with di↵erent levels of budget constraints. The cost-effectiveness of each block of budget spent on a threat is determined by minimising its expected total cost, including the damages it inflicts and the control expenditures incurred in preventing or mitigating damages. In this way, rates of return from a given biosecurity measure are maximised. BCRs can be positive at di↵erent scales, in other words, but the key is to find the largest di↵erence between benefits and costs. {\textbackslash}par This report, for CEBRA Project 1608A, illustrates these points, in terms of: (a) the optimal trade-o↵ between border and post-border biosecurity expenditures, and (b) the optimal level of post-border ‘early detection’ of an exotic pest. The case we examine is papaya fruit fly (PFF) through the Torres Strait pathway, although the principles apply broadly. The border is taken as trapping (and other) activity in the Torres Straight Islands (TSI) and post-border is defined by a surveillance measure in northern Queensland. {\textbackslash}par In terms of (a), allocations between border and post-border surveillance depend on a host of complicated issues, and a set of parameters that drive a computational outcome. That said, the idea is simple: we need to find a set of measures, at the border and post-border, that maximise rates of returns by minimising the sum of all potential damages and the cost of the biosecurity measures themselves. This is equivalent to finding an allocation that ensures that the extra benefits of combined biosecurity measures, border and post-border, in terms of all the avoided losses that go with these measures, exactly equal the extra costs of providing the measures themselves. {\textbackslash}par In this part of the report the key parameters are average arrival rates, spread rates, eradications costs, the discount rate, and the effectiveness of quarantine and surveillance measures. Using these (and other) baseline parameter values we can calculate optimal border quarantine and post-border surveillance measures. The results from the PFF case determine an overall optimal expenditure or portfolio allocation at a ratio of 1:5 for border and post-border measures. Given parameter values, in other words, and although both activities are valuable, it pays to invest more in post-border surveillance than at the border. Sensitivity results outline the range of possibilities given changes in parameter values. {\textbackslash}par In terms of (b), allocating resources for post-border surveillance, taken separately, given border quarantine measures, also generates an issue of value versus value-added or what the best rate of return should be. For a trapping network for the ‘early detection’ of fruit flies, for example, the question is, put simply, how early to detect a possible incursion in order to maximize the probability of eradication. A trapping grid that is very ‘tight’, with many traps placed in host-suitable areas will detect very early, but then the cost of the program itself, with a large number of traps, is very expensive. Having less traps means the cost of the surveillance program is lower, but then detection will be later and thus potential avoided losses will be higher. In total, if the extra benefits of adding more traps exceed the extra costs, that investment should take place, and continue to take place until extra benefits exactly equal extra costs. {\textbackslash}par In this part of the report, which modifies and extends material contained in CEBRA Project Report 1405C, Baseline ‘Consequence Measures’ for Australia from the Torres Strait Islands Pathway to Queensland: Papaya Fruit Fly, Citrus Canker and Rabies, we illustrate how to determine an optimal point of early detection. The parameter set is further complicated with control costs, production losses, the costs of trapping, and the probability of a given fruit fly to find a nearby host, among other things. Results indicate an optimal grid size of less than 1km, much less than current practice. As expected, a grid size that is much smaller than this implies that the cost of the program is too large relative to the extra benefits (in terms of the smaller avoided losses that go with early detection). A grid size that is larger than 1km generates relatively large and (otherwise) potentially avoided losses. The best grid size is illustrated by the minimum of all losses and expenditures. This maximises the rate of return from the surveillance activity. Model runs and sensitivity analysis further elaborate the role of border versus post-border biosecurity measures in terms of changes in the ‘arrival rate’ and its effect on expenditures. {\textbackslash}par Recommendations 1. Both the basic and the more complex spatial model in this report perform well, and clearly illustrate tradeo↵s between border and post-border expenditures on biosecurity. This forms a basis for discussions of resource allocation across various biosecurity measures, and should be further developed or refined going forward. 2. Although data and estimations are available for most of what is needed, the model framework likely requires a more careful calibration of parameter values, especially in cases where model results are most sensitive to changes in these values, and where measures of ‘effectiveness’ of border and post-border activities are needed. 3. Pre-border expenditures could be added to the model framework, in principle, given needed data and estimates of underlying parameter values. This should be pursued going forward to allow for best ‘portfolio allocations’ of biosecurity expenditures across the entire spectrum of biosecurity measures.},

	abstract = {The main aim of biosecurity response to an incursion is to achieve pest- or disease-free status as quickly as possible. One of the critical initial response activities involves tracing known movements (trace events) to and from an infected or infested property (IP) that could spread the pest or pathogen. During an incursion response, managers prioritize individual trace events, allocating surveillance resources to follow-up trace events in order of priority. Prioritizing trace events is difficult and typically subjective. We present a simulation model where different dispersal mechanisms spread a pest or pathogen between areas. We use model outputs to test different search strategies, using citrus canker (caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas citri) as a case study. Model scenarios are based on an outbreak of citrus canker that occurred in Emerald, Queensland, in 2004. {\textbackslash}par Model parameters were extracted from published scientific reports and elicited from experts. We used model outputs to assess four search strategies to determine how best to monitor citrus canker spread. Parameters governing disease detectability and host susceptibility were varied in a sensitivity analysis. {\textbackslash}par Flexible simulation software was implemented in program R. Whilst the simulator can be parameterised for many outbreak situations, no general rules can be established using the results of this study on citrus canker for tracing other pests or diseases: the simulator should be used on a case-by-case basis. {\textbackslash}par In all simulation scenarios, the “adaptive radius” rule performed best, whereby a circular search area was placed around the IP where the disease outbreak was first detected, with a radius proportional to the estimated number of months the property was infected. Importantly, none of the search rules tested detected all IPs without completely searching all properties with susceptible hosts in the region. {\textbackslash}par We identify a simple rule of thumb for searching during a citrus canker outbreak that is robust to uncertainty. No general rules can be established using the results of this study for tracing other pests or pathogens. The model has created a framework that may be used to explore other contexts and disease dynamics, leading perhaps to more general rules for disease outbreak management.},

	abstract = {New Zealand has a highly valued and internationally respected seed growing and seed export industry due to its disease-free status and the ability to provide additional growing seasons for Northern Hemisphere producers. The success of the industry is dependent on the ability to import seed of a wide variety of species and from different production areas. The Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) is responsible for managing the biosecurity risks associated with seed imports which includes the importation of high value seeds as small seed lots. {\textbackslash}par At present the only option available for seed importers of small seed lots (under 2500 seeds) wishing to import into New Zealand, is to source the seed from countries that are declared free from the regulated diseases listed in the Import Health Standard (IHS) 155.02.05: Seeds for Sowing [8]. This requirement limits the number of countries/suppliers that are eligible to supply the various commodities. {\textbackslash}par In order to maximise the sustainability and growth of the New Zealand seed export industry, an alternative seed testing protocol designed specifically for importing small seed lots is required. The sampling protocol must be flexible enough to help facilitate frequent imports of different volumes of seeds, species, and various geographic locations. {\textbackslash}par In this report, we provide a detailed discussion on an approach which may be used to manage the pathway-level risk of contaminated seed being imported into New Zealand. In any system reliant on sampling to detect contamination, contaminated product may be missed and subsequently imported; this is known as leakage. The proposed approach that we detail provides, at a minimum, an architecture for interrogating the effect of such leakage. In particular, we show the impacts of lot size on possible leakage rates. Further, the approach that we detail may be used alongside detailed pest risk analyses to determine an acceptable leakage rate for a pathway, and subsequently provide a mechanism for calculating a sample size required for testing on a lot-by-lot basis. The system that we detail thus manages the whole-of-pathway risk, rather than the risk on an individual lot basis, as per the current system. {\textbackslash}par Additionally, this report provides a summary of the relevant methods that are described in the International standards for phytosanitary measures: ISPM 31, methodologies for sampling of consignments [5] for calculating sample sizes in relatively small lots. Whilst we acknowledge that the New Zealand’s Ministry for Primary Industries already has such a methodology at its disposal, we use this report to stress its importance, and further provide an example software application that can be tailored to MPI’s specific import requirements. {\textbackslash}par The full list of recommendations from this report are provided in the List of Recommendations, however at a minimum we suggest that MPI continue to utilise and expand upon the ISPM 31 methodology (which uses the Hypergeometric distribution) of sample size calculation for imports of small seed lots. We also suggest that consideration be made into the effects of leaked contaminated seed, and that the novel approach of controlling such leakage be entertained as a way to manage pathway-level risk of seeds for sowing.},

	url = {https://cebra.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/2068691/1003-final-report.pdf},
	abstract = {This report documents stages 1, 2, 4, and 5 of ACERA Project 1003 as well as initial progress on stage 7. The report assesses online systems for biosecurity intelligence–gathering and analysis against DAFF’s intelligence needs (stage 2), which were evaluated in a workshop on 14/08/2009 (stage 1). The report also assesses existing online animal biosecurity intelligence systems (stage 4) and plant biosecurity intelligence options (stage 5). Work on stage 5 lead to the development of a prototype plant health intelligence system, thus making initial progress on stage 7. It also lead to the development of a more sophisticated prototype intelligence system for marine pests and diseases. The main findings of this report are: 1. The reviewed biosecurity intelligence systems do not satisfy DAFF’s intelligence needs. There is virtually no coverage of plant pests and diseases, and the same is true for marine/aquatic pests and diseases. Although animal pests and diseases are better covered, the reviewed systems still fail to satisfy DAFF’s biosecurity intelligence needs. 2. DAFF staff are crippled by current IT restrictions. The situation is so dire that in order to complete various stages of this research project, ACERA had to supply some members of DAFF with laptops with independent and unrestricted internet connections. These laptops have since proven to be indispensable to staff conducting modern biosecurity intelligence gathering and analysis. 3. There is a significant amount of important information pertaining to biosecurity intelligence in new online media such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, podcasts, and RSS feeds. DAFF staff are currently unable to access this information. Similarly, a wealth of information exists in scholarly journals, forums, discussion boards, and webinars. For various reasons, DAFF staff are unable to access this information and this is seriously affecting their ability to acquire and analyse biosecurity intelligence. 4. There is a huge opportunity for DAFF to be an international leader in modern biosecurity intelligence, especially for plant and marine/aquatic pests and diseases. Initial progress has already been made in developing a sophisticated marine and aquatic biosecurity intelligence system. This work was done during stage 5 of this project in collaboration with Dr Geoff Grossel from the Aquatic Division of Animal Biosecurity in the BSG. One early version of this system (developed by Dr Grossel) has already lead to a concrete decision that mitigated a serious biosecurity risk: oyster or ostreid herpesvirus (OsHV–1 or OsHV–1 µvar) entering Australia. The system gave early warning of the disease spreading through Europe, and the probability of it spreading to Australia through the importation of used oyster farming equipment. Based on this information, it was decided that all such equipment should be decontaminated before leaving quarantine. New Zealand was not in a position to make this decision, and the virus has now spread to New Zealand oyster farms. {\textbackslash}par Biosecurity information now exists in many forms on the internet. In the past, such information was mostly contained in news articles, which users would have to access directly or through a search engine (e.g., Google). However, RSS feeds have gained widespread use on the internet, and now articles from news media sites can be delivered to users as soon as they are published online. This means that biosecurity information can be brought to users as soon as it is published on the web. {\textbackslash}par This stream of information can be automatically collected, sorted, translated, and enriched. For example, an article in Spanish with the symptom terms ‘apatia’ (apathy), ‘deshidratación’ (dehydration), ‘náusea’ (nausea), and location term ‘Peru’ can be automatically detected in a newspaper’s RSS feed and classified as likely to be about a cholera outbreak in Peru—even though the term ‘cholera’ is not in the original article. This enriched report can be published to a number of other RSS feeds, which can be tailored to the interests of health officials. One such RSS feed could be devoted to all articles on potential cholera outbreaks. Another could be for all articles on any public health issue in Peru. There is no limit to how RSS feeds can be filtered and recombined in this way. {\textbackslash}par Since the establishment of RSS feeds on the web, new types of feeds have emerged. Geo–RSS and KML feeds allow articles to be tagged with latitude and longitude co–ordinates. This means that information can be streamed to mapping systems (such as Google Maps and Google Earth) that allow information to be plotted on a map. Instead of a simple list of articles on potential cholera outbreaks around the world, a health official can view a map in which those articles are plotted. This allows the official to achieve so–called ‘situational awareness” (i.e., to see potential clusters of reports, or other pattens in the data). This map can be updated automatically as new articles are published. {\textbackslash}par Automated systems will always produce errors. A system may ascribe a collection of symptoms to be indicative of cholera, when in fact those symptoms are more likely to be caused by some other disease. GPHIN and WDIN are two systems that use dedicated experts to review their reports in order to reduce such errors. In contrast, ProMED is completely expert based (it has no automation). At the other extreme, BioCaster is completely automated, not relying on any (direct) input from experts. An approach that is between these two extremes—partly taken by HealthMap—is to allow users to make contributions to the system with commentary, rankings of relevance, etc. This approach is sometimes called a ‘Web 2.0’ approach as it takes advantage of the knowledge that can be generated by large numbers of users interacting through a software system. (Wikipedia, for example, is a Web 2.0 application.) This sort of approach has the advantage of making use of human analysis for free. {\textbackslash}par A similar approach is taken by EpiSPIDER, which collects information from Twitter. By watching Twitter for biosecurity–related search terms, EpiSPIDER gathers articles that have been read and perhaps even categorised by users. Moreover, this can be done without the users knowing it. Someone travelling in Thailand could tweet a webpage on, say, a concert being cancelled, which also pertains to biosecurity—e.g., the concert is cancelled due to organisers fear of a dengue outbreak. This may be the only source of information on this issue, and it can be detected by EpiSPIDER, even though no one consciously reported the webpage for this purpose. {\textbackslash}par Since such user input and feedback can reduce errors and increase the number of reliable sources, some biosecurity intelligence systems appear to be moving to use social media. There are important questions concerning the reliability of social media compared with standard news media. Such issues are studied in social epistemology (e.g., on the reliability of blogs versus news media, see Goldman [2008]). Probabilistic models from the literature on judgement aggregation and consensus formation have been also studied with respect to potential biosecurity applications (see ACERA Project 607). More research in formal methods of social epistemology (with a focus on applications to biosecurity intelligence) needs to be conducted as biosecurity intelligence systems move to social media. {\textbackslash}par The report confirms that the available software systems do not adequately meet DAFF’s needs— particularly in the domains of plant, marine, and aquatic pests and diseases. None of the systems give substantial attention to plant and marine biosecurity—indeed, they give very little to no coverage. Although human, animal and zoonotic diseases are better covered, focus tends to be on diseases that attract significant coverage in the news media (e.g., H1N1). As part of stage 7, two prototype systems were developed for plant and marine biosecurity. Initial results from the prototypes suggest that further investigation and development of plant and marine biosecurity intelligence systems would be of significant advantage to DAFF. It is highly recommended that these prototypes be further developed and supported. The development of these prototypes should be guided by a study of the pros and cons of existing biosecurity intelligence systems as well as research in social epistemology. It is crucial that the prototypes remain open–source and unhindered by DAFF’s IT restrictions. It would also be of considerable advantage to DAFF if there were systems that covered less well–reported animal diseases, and acquired intelligence from a greater range of conventional sources (e.g., scientific journals) as well as less conventional sources (e.g., social media). More detailed recommendations for how to further develop the prototypes are given in Section 9.1. {\textbackslash}par The marine prototype system analysed information from Twitter and it was noticed that topics that received a lot of attention on Twitter were typically already known or not of interest to DAFF. This suggests that Twitter could be used to filter out topics which DAFF staff do not need intelligence on, thus allowing them to focus on issues important to them. It was also noticed that Twitter was the first or sole source of information on some events which were potentially important to DAFF. Moreover, it was discovered that there are informal networks of people sharing biosecurity information within Twitter.1 {\textbackslash}par Many of the systems reviewed in this report are biosecurity intelligence systems that are web– based and open–source. Enterprise search systems, which in contrast are closed–source, have not been reviewed in this report. However, it is likely that the implementation of an enterprise search system, such as MS FAST or ISYS, would be of great benefit to DAFF, since such a system would allow information to be shared within DAFF in an intelligent way. It should be noted, though, that an enterprise search system does not perform the same functions that open–source web– based systems perform. Although enterprise search systems can search the internet for biosecurity information in more–or–less the same fashion as open–source web–based systems do, the results of such searches are not open–source and are accessible only to those who have access to the enterprise search system. Systems such as ProMED clearly demonstrate that there is great value in allowing the global community to view the results, since users of the system can contribute back into the system, by confirming/disconfirming initial reports, submitting new information missed by the system, etc. {\textbackslash}par These two types of systems are not in conflict, and in fact complement each other. An enterprise search system can be used to organise and share information within DAFF that may be of a sensitive nature and not to be shared with the rest of the world. A web–based open–source system can be used by DAFF staff to interact with experts in the global community to acquire intelligence that would otherwise not be able to be obtained. This intelligence can then be fed into the enterprise search system to add to the quality of that information. Implementation of both types of systems would probably best serve DAFF’s biosecurity intelligence needs. {\textbackslash}par Access to the diverse and new sources of biosecurity intelligence is crucial to meet many of DAFF’s biosecurity intelligence needs. Currently, DAFF staff are unable to access these sources due to content bans and IT restrictions. Access is needed to RSS and KML feeds; podcasts; webinars (online seminars); blogs; Twitter; online video and audio content; YouTube; Wikis (including Wikipedia); as well as journals, discussion boards, and online forums.},

	abstract = {The Australian Department of Agriculture (Aust. DA) and the New Zealand Ministry of Primary Industries (NZ MPI) make various biosecurity decisions that require spatial predictions of the likelihood of pest occurrence or the suitability of potential habitat. A number of modelling tools can inform these decisions, which can be broadly characterised as correlative approaches and process-based approaches. The project used marine and terrestrial case studies to explore their ‘defensibility’, which focussed on their performance, and their ‘usability’, which focussed on their ease and cost of use. The project provided no clear consensus that currently available spatial tools will provide adequate solutions for all relevant scenarios. For the marine case it was concluded that a method is required that considers the degree of environmental similarity between source and sink environments, time in donor and recipient ports, and attributes from transit routes of vessels. For terrestrial scenarios it was concluded that process-based models are currently more appropriate for making defensible predictions, but may be more difficult to implement when data are poor and are thus not always suitable for government decision making. Hence, models were proposed that would use a mixture of expert opinion and correlative methods to determine key variables in the native range and the results would be used to make predictions in Australia/New Zealand. New research should explore the relative performance of these approaches and compare the practicalities of implementing them. Developing new methods will also require developing and retaining the expertise to apply them. This project is the basis for two new CEBRA projects that will implement the ideas that emerged: CEBRA projects 1402A: “Development of a marine spatial analysis model for improved biofouling risk assessment”; and 1402B: “Tools and approaches for invasive species distribution modelling for surveillance”.},

	abstract = {Background: DAFF intercepts pests, which may be regulated, and therefore actionable. The Operational Science Program (OSP) identifies the intercepted pests to determine their biosecurity status. The results of identification are recorded in the Incidents database. Not all pests are identified to the species level. A range of factors affects the amount of information available about any interception, so the Incidents database does not support statistical analysis, and DAFF cannot accurately evaluate the relative biosecurity risk posed by different pathways. {\textbackslash}par Overview: This project develops a sampling-based identification protocol which will result in identification data that supports statistical analysis. {\textbackslash}par Outcomes: The following outcomes arise from this report. 1. Overall OSP species level IDs have improved from around 25\% in the mid to late 1990’s to around 42\% in 2012. 2. The main improvements have come from specialised training and the publication of taxonomic keys and manuals. 3. To our knowledge, no international organization has been able to solve the problem of the non-representativeness of captured specimen data. 4. We develop a candidate scheme under which all intercepted specimens are submitted to OSP, and OSP implements a stratified sampling regime to determine which specimens to identify. {\textbackslash}par Recommendations: The following recommendations arise from this report. 1. Develop a trial of the sampling approach sketched herein (p. 24). 2. Free up OSP time to invest in spending time with border programs (p. 27). 3. Streamline Incidents data entry to enable more complete data capture (p. 26). 4. Improve feedback between OSP and border inspection staff (p. 27). 5. Maintain and increase specialised training of OSP staff with external experts (p. 27).},

Tests will likely require minimal operator training to perform (sample-to-answer systems). {\textbackslash}par Prompt diagnosis of EADs minimises their economic and public health effects. POC tests can reduce the time required to make a diagnosis of these diseases. A decision by public sector agencies to use POC tests as an aid in managing EADs depends on the purpose of testing, including the stage of the outbreak and response, whether the benefits outweigh the costs of test and equipment deployment, and whether they offer advantages over existing protocols for disease management based on clinical suspicion and submission of samples to a laboratory.

	url = {https://cebra.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/2220873/0902_final-report.pdf},
	abstract = {Invasive species are a major threat to ecosystems worldwide. Once invasive species have established, even with a determined commitment to control, contain or eradicate an invasive species, it is often difficult to decide on the most efficient and effective management strategy due to the complex interaction of factors such as the extent of the invasion, the ecology of the species, the dynamics of the system, and how the species responds to different management actions. Invasive species by their very nature disperse through a system at a rapid rate, indeed their spread and persistence is often driven by a spatial network of infestations in the landscape. If spatial processes are ignored in our decisionmaking process we may allocate time and money managing individual infestations while key areas driving the spread of the species are inefficiently controlled. Under such a scenario attaining our goals of eradicating or controlling spread of an invasive species may not be attained, having dire consequences for environments we are trying to protect. {\textbackslash}par Prioritising the management of invasive species across the landscape to maximise our chance of eradicating an invasive species can be modelled as a Markov decision processes (MDP) and solved using stochastic dynamic programming methods. Managing invasive species spatially is a challenging theoretical problem due to Bellman‟s curse of dimensionality: the computational complexity grows exponentially with the number of parcels in the system. Another practical issue arises with classic SDP method; the solution proposed only present one optimal strategy amongst a set of possible alternatives constraining decision managers to one option. Using networks as a spatial representation of our optimisation problem we overcome these drawbacks using structured MDP and algebraic decision diagrams (ADD) representations. By doing so we take advantage of the structured colonisation processes between parcels and provide for the first time the set of all optimal strategies to manage invasive species on a network. Under general assumptions we derive rules of thumb for some key network structures. {\textbackslash}par Using MDP assumes we can observe the system perfectly and determine which parcel is infected or not. In reality we often do not have access to this information. Partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model tackles the problem of deciding the most appropriate management action given the difficulty of detecting invasive species. Work by Regan et al (in review) has looked into the optimal management of an invasive weed branched broomrape (Orobanche ramosa) under imperfect detection addressing the key issue of management at a single parcel level. Here, we account for the spatial components of the system and how spatial considerations may affect optimal management of a cryptic invasive species. Using structured POMDP and network representation, we investigate the role space plays in optimally managing invasive species and produce the first spatially explicit decision support tool for managing cryptic invasive species. We provide general rules of thumb that can be applied to a range of species in diverse situations.},

	abstract = {Australia operates one of the most comprehensive biosecurity systems in the world. However, due to the system’s size and complexity, it is unclear exactly how much monetary 'value' it generates and where that value is generated within the system. Without a clear understanding of the net benefits obtained from the existing investment in biosecurity activities it is difficult to determine the extent to which the system is achieving its desired objectives (its ‘health’) and also whether there is scope to increase either the value or health of the system by altering the allocation of resources. {\textbackslash}par Past attempts to value the biosecurity system have been based on ad-hoc and/or qualitative statements of overall benefits or limited to specific major pests or diseases, such as an estimate of the consequences of an incursion of foot and mouth disease in Australia. Consequently, where estimates of value do exist, they have typically been calculated using different measures of value; inconsistent or incomplete monetisation of impacts; incompatible assumptions or counterfactuals; and/or over different temporal or spatial scales. To the best of our knowledge, no equivalent economic evaluation of an entire biosecurity system, or at least a major part of the system, has ever been successfully completed. {\textbackslash}par Given the scale of the task of estimating value at the system level, a staged approach is required. The first phase of CEBRA project 1607A delivered a comprehensive review of the biosecurity economics literature, and identified suitable methods, measures and indicators of the types of value generated by biosecurity interventions. The purpose of this report is to develop that review into a framework for estimating the value of Australia’s biosecurity system through a multi-year project. {\textbackslash}par We begin by explicitly defining the set of participants, their activities and outputs that collectively comprise Australia’s biosecurity system. Then, following the generic framework of Boardman et al. (2011), we propose a specific combination of approaches for estimating the value of that system based on its unique characteristics (rather than some theoretical ideal). Throughout the report we draw on a number of case studies to highlight several important issues, or their solutions, that have been identified by the project team over the first twelve months. {\textbackslash}par In total, we provide seventeen recommendations (see over) that collectively outline a measured and pragmatic approach for estimating the value of Australia’s biosecurity system. Wherever possible, we recommend leveraging the existing tools employed by the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources (DAWR) and the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES), augmenting these methods only where necessary to improve accuracy or defensibility (such as accounting for changes in consumer surplus). Importantly, we also propose limiting the scope in several respects (such as the breadth of impacts considered), to help keep the valuation tractable in its first iteration. {\textbackslash}par Finally, although the recommendations that comprise our framework are not novel or controversial from an economic evaluation standpoint, we are not aware of any existing analysis of an Australian biosecurity program that has fully implemented this approach. Consequently, we also recommend that this approach be used as a standardised template for conducting any future evaluations of Australian biosecurity interventions, including those outside the scope of our project, so that their results can be more readily incorporated into any future estimates of the system’s value.},

They may provide early warning of changes in the nature and frequency of risks on pathways. {\textbackslash}par Process-based methods such as Failure Mode and Effect Analysis, (FMEA), Hazard and Operability Studies (HAZOP), and Hazard and Critical Control Point analysis (HACCP) can be time-consuming but may have a place in biosecurity in assessing existing operational procedures, identifying weaknesses, and anticipating faults especially when failures are critical. For instance, HACCP may be useful for assessing the possibility of substituting one management system (or set of quarantine measures) for another, evaluating system equivalence and the potential for failures in the candidate system. {\textbackslash}par Causal analysis techniques are applied typically after a serious system failure. Examples demonstrate that complex systems are not easily identified from this type of analysis, even after the event. This is a critical point for biosecurity applications. Systems that depend on complex human factors require explicit analysis using tools developed for such situations. {\textbackslash}par ‘Human factors analysis’ aims to describe, predict, and manage human behaviour to achieve operational goals. These methods provide a framework for understanding how systems can become error-prone, and how procedures may be implemented to anticipate and remedy these situations. Application of human factors analysis to the two case studies illustrates how it may have been useful in elaborating the causes of failure and identifying systemic changes that would reduce the chances of repetition of such events.

	url = {https://cebra.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/2068651/0705a_final-report.pdf},
	abstract = {This report reviews uncertainty and uncertainty analysis methods in risk assessment, with a specific focus on issues related to import risk assessment. The report is motivated by the availability of qualitative and quantitative methods for import risk assessment. It examines how the challenges posed by uncertainty influence choices between these two approaches. The project’s terms of reference are to summarise and categorise the different sources of uncertainty in risk assessment problems, and review the practicality and applicability of a range of treatment methods. The report is intended for scientists and managers involved in, or contemplating the use of, qualitative or quantitative risk assessment. Whilst the report focusses on import risk assessment, readers from other application domains will find that much of the information and analysis presented here is relevant to them. {\textbackslash}par Uncertainty is a term used to encompass many concepts. It has been described, defined and categorised in many different ways, using different names for the same things and occasionally the same name for different things. This report identifies four basic sources of uncertainty: uncertainty that arises through the vagarious nature of language (linguistic uncertainty), the uncertainty created by our limited understanding of natural systems (epistemic uncertainty), the uncertainty created by the irreducible variation in these systems (variability), and finally the uncertainty associated with our value systems and management decisions (decision uncertainty). {\textbackslash}par The report examines in detail the various sources of linguistic uncertainty, epistemic uncertainty and variability in scientific endeavors and risk-related problems. It summarises probabilistic, non-probabilistic and graphical methods for treating and propagating these sources of uncertainty through risk assessment under the headings of five basic strategies: ignore it, eliminate it, envelope it, average over it or factorise it. It also examines the related problem of dependency that occurs when arithmetic operations are performed with random variables. {\textbackslash}par The principal impediment to uncertainty analysis within qualitative risk assessment is that variability and epistemic uncertainty are confounded with each other and with linguistic uncertainty. Separating the three sources of uncertainty requires, as a minimum, that linguistic uncertainty is eliminated from the problem as far as possible. Fuzzy sets and possibility theory provide a mechanism that was specifically designed to eliminate two important sources of linguistic uncertainty (vagueness and ambiguity). These sources of uncertainty, however, can also be eliminated with probability theory via carefully implemented elicitation methods and probability bounds analysis. This approach has the additional advantages of: a) being able to minimise other well known heuristics and biases in human perception and judgements of uncertain events; and, b) couching its analysis within the realms of probability theory which is likely to be more familiar to decision makers than evidence or possibility theory. {\textbackslash}par Furthermore, there are a range of issues with qualitative approaches to risk assessment that relate to the science-quality criteria of transparency, repeatability and falsifiability, and the decisionutility criteria of precision and accuracy, namely: • qualitative risk assessment predictions cannot be (in)validated with observations, and uncertainty cannot be coherently propagated through risk functions without translating qualitative metrics of likelihood or consequence into numerical metrics; • arithmetic operations, such as product, performed with linguistic descriptions of likelihood and/or consequence can be biased and non-commutative. These problems only become apparent when vagueness is eliminated from the analysis using numerical definitions of terms such as “high”, “medium” or “low”. This report uses interval analysis to show that the qualitative risk operations performed by the AGDAFF for import risk assessment lead to biased and non-commutative results; and, • the effects of dependency between risk-generating events cannot be coherently explored with qualitative descriptions of uncertain events, leading to different interpretations of observed outcomes and potentially paradoxical assumptions about the relatively likelihood of events. {\textbackslash}par The problem of epistemic uncertainty and variability in quantitative risk assessment starts with the availability of data. This report distinguishes data - observations of a process - understanding and beliefs about a process. The key to uncertainty analysis in the absence of data is elicitation. Elicitation converts beliefs into outcomes, models or parameters that enable regression and forward propagative uncertainty analysis. Again, structured elicitation techniques also provide an opportunity to avoid or minimise heuristic bias and dysfunctional group effects, and are therefore “good practice” in quantitative risk assessment. {\textbackslash}par Import risk assessment is often performed in the absence of empirical observations. Uncertainty analysis in this context can be performed using elicitation and forward uncertainty propagation methods. The key challenges associated with epistemic uncertainty and variability can be addressed or eliminated by making assumptions about the structure of the risk-generating process (the model), the shape, scale and/or location of the probability distribution(s) that represent variability and/or epistemic uncertainty in model parameters, and the nature of the dependency between the parameters of the model. These types of assumptions have an important bearing on the results of the risk assessment. The principal objectives of propagative uncertainty analysis are to report, and where practical, test the effect of these assumptions on the overall risk estimate, and in doing so achieve an honest assessment. In approaching this problem the analyst can adopt one or more of the strategies identified above, namely: • simply ignore: this is sometimes defensible for parametric uncertainty and model structure uncertainty, but only in limited circumstances. For example, model structure uncertainty can be ignored where the model or risk function is dictated by legislation or guidelines. In this context the risk assessment results are only defensible as a guide to the relative magnitude of risk but this can be useful as a risk-screening decision aid; • eliminate: this is possible for variability (and to a limited degree dependence) by either building a more complex risk model that models variability or via choosing a simpler assessment endpoint that enables a simpler risk model with a lower parameter dimension. The first approach may not be attractive in data-limited circumstances because it can increase model structure uncertainty. The latter approach is only tenable if meaningful decision criteria can be stipulated by a decision maker for the simpler endpoint; • compare and envelope: comparative strategies are akin to sensitivity analysis and seek to highlight the effect of assumptions on risk estimates. Enveloping methodologies place bounds on the best and worst estimates and seek to guarantee that the true result will lie within these bounds. Interval analysis, probability boxes and probability bounds analysis can satisfy this guarantee for variability and dependence with minimal conditions, for example, that the true value of an uncertain quantity lies within an elicited interval. Overconfident expert opinion is clearly a challenge in this regard. Info-gap theory attempts to place an upper bound on the effects of uncertainty on decisions but its recommendations may be sensitive to initial conditions. Moreover, comparison and enveloping cannot guarantee that the effects of model structure uncertainty have been completely addressed because the set of possible models is infinite. In the absence of data and statistical inference this problem is unconstrained but is best approached by consulting widely and comparing as many plausible models as is possible within the resources available to the study. Techniques such as influence diagrams, loop analysis and fuzzy cognitive maps can be helpful in this context; • average over: an analyst can average over variability and several sources of epistemic uncertainty, including model structure uncertainty, using techniques such as second-order Monte Carlo Simulation and Bayesian model averaging. Again, however, in the absence of data this problem is unconstrained and computationally more demanding than the compare and envelope strategy. The range of plausible model structures, or alternative probability density functions, that can be addressed within the resources of a single study are therefore likely to be smaller with this strategy, and in the case of model structure uncertainty it can lead to risk estimates that are incompatible with accepted theories; and. • model and factorise: this strategy is applicable to variability and dependence and in the presence of data also provides a means to identify parsimonious descriptions of cause and effect and thereby treat model structure uncertainty. Copulas and Bayesian networks can be used to treat dependence and partition different sources of variability in a risk assessment problem. These methods can be used in data-poor situations but the lack of data-based constraints can still undermine attempts to provide a systematic analysis. Moreover, the full benefits of Bayesian networks, and statistical graph theory and hierarchical modeling in general, cannot be realised in the absence of data. {\textbackslash}par Virtually all risk assessment frameworks emphasise the importance of monitoring and review, and this report emphasises that scientifically credible risk assessments should ultimately become a statistical exercise by making predictions about the risk-generating process that are testable and eventually tested against observations. Any historical distinction between uncertainty analysis and statistics is not constructive in a risk assessment context. A more useful distinction is to consider forward uncertainty propagation methods as the initial tools of uncertainty analysis that enable honest assessments to proceed before observations are made and data are collected. Thereafter, uncertainty analysis should increasingly move to an inferential mode that relies on statistics and uncertainty analysis methods to characterise and quantify variability and epistemic uncertainty in data sets relevant to the problem in hand. {\textbackslash}par A synthesis of these discussions, together with an examination of the pros and cons of different uncertainty analysis methods, suggests the following overall strategy for uncertainty analysis in import risk assessment: 1. use formal elicitation techniques to canvass the opinions, construct conceptual models and parameterize the beliefs of stakeholders and experts. Use either predictive or structural elicitation methods to convert conceptual models into statistical, qualitative and/or mechanistic models and convert beliefs about stochastic variables into numerical intervals with assigned levels of confidence; 2. ensure feedback is embedded within the elicitation procedure (to minimise the potential for misunderstanding) and apply an advocacy-like procedure to ensure that all aspects of the risk assessment are rigorously reviewed; 3. state risk-decision criteria (risk acceptability levels) in a numeric, measurable fashion for as many of the steps in the risk-generating process as is possible, including steps leading up to the overall assessment endpoint; 4. maintain plausible diverse opinions and in the first instance envelope this diversity using techniques such as loop analysis, comparisons of alternative risk functions, interval analysis, probability boxes and probability bounds analysis. If the upper bound on the subsequent risk estimate is lower than the decision criteria associated with the assessment endpoint, report the result and consider the need for monitoring strategies that enable (in)validation of as many of the steps in the risk-generating process as possible within the resources available to the assessment. If possible, collect data and use statistical inference methods to check that the risk-generating process is operating within the bounds predicted for each step of the process by the risk assessment; 5. if the lower bound on the enveloped risk estimate is higher than the decision criteria associated with the assessment endpoint consider prohibiting, stopping or otherwise mitigating the risk-generating process and if necessary repeat the risk assessment with risk management steps in place, and include within the assessment the impact of management, and the effects of decision uncertainty upon this; and, 6. if the upper and lower bounds of the enveloped risk estimate straddle the decision criteria associated with the assessment endpoint consider first the effects of dependence and the mitigating effects of positive or negative dependence. For example, a potential application of positive quadrant dependence arises in import risk assessment because the probability of detecting organisms at the border should be positively dependent on the number of organisms that arrive at the border - i.e. as the number of infected units rises so should the probability of their detection. Treating these events as independent denies the reality of inspection regimes, inflates uncertainty bounds and can lead to paradoxical simulations where large numbers of infected units are multiplied by a small probability of detection (and vice-versa) in naive simulations. {\textbackslash}par The strategy outlined above is designed to enable uncertainty analysis with the minimum amount of assumptions. The objective here is for the assessment to be roughly right rather than precisely wrong. If the enveloped predictions continue to cross the assessment endpoint then two avenues are available to the assessor and manager: • consider prohibiting or otherwise deferring the risk-generating process and the risk assessment, and collect data that enables statistical inference and a more precise empirical estimate of the risk function (statistical or mechanistic model) and/or the variables (risk factors) associated with this model; or, • use the most plausible assumptions about the model structure and its variables to provide a more precise risk prediction by modeling and/or factorising the uncertainty associated with the problem using techniques such as Bayesian Networks and second-order Monte Carlo Simulation supported by linear or non-linear estimates of dependence. {\textbackslash}par It is very important with the second option that the assumptions associated with the analysis are clearly communicated together with the effects of alternative plausible assumptions on the risk estimate where possible. It is also important that monitoring strategies are designed and implemented in order to (in)validate as many of the steps in the risk-generating process as possible and thereby enable a gradual departure from data-poor circumstances to data-rich circumstances, and a move towards the inference opportunities of modern statistical methods.},

	abstract = {This report presents the findings of a field-based study on biosecurity risk communication in the Yass region. The study tested the usefulness of a „mental models‟ approach to support communication strategies for the management of pests and diseases in this area. {\textbackslash}par The study found that the size of landholdings was not an important factor associated with knowledge and behaviour about biosecurity issues. Between 80 and 100\% of people were aware of the main vectors and pathways for both weeds and animal diseases. Similarly high percentages of respondents employ appropriate risk management practices. There were lower levels of awareness of animal diseases than of weeds. The term „biosecurity‟ was not widely understood. {\textbackslash}par The study‟s findings, based on the „mental models‟ approach, suggested that a biosecurity communication strategy for the region should be developed and delivered on a landscape scale, be directed to all landholders, and appeal to the drivers that the landholders themselves identified, specifically with respect to weed control – good land management, being a good neighbour and cost management. It should use trusted, influential agencies and use existing local networks to disseminate information.},

	abstract = {A class of multi-criteria methods commonly used in environmental decision-making employ the weighted linear average algorithm (including the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP)). This review identifies that the final decision or ranking of options depends on the choice of performance scoring scales, even when the criteria weights are held constant. The report evaluates the “sensitivity” of results to the choice to performance scales. It concludes that it is possible to change the final ranking of options just by recalibrating the scoring scales for the criteria. {\textbackslash}par This arbitrariness is not a feature or a fault of the MCDA model. It is a misuse of the weighted average decision method. To address the issue, the report recommends that analysts ensure that the weights for numerical criteria reflect the relative importance of the criteria, and that they are conditioned on the way in which the performance-scoring scales for the criteria are calibrated.},
