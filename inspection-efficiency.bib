  abstract = {Background: DAFF has adopted a risk-based approach to managing the biosecurity risk of various pathways, including international passengers and mail. During Increased Quarantine Intervention (IQI), introduced in 2001, inspection effectiveness had been used as the primary indicator of inspectorate performance. A risk-based approach to management requires a richer suite of indicators that will better align with DAFF values. ACERA Project 1001i Performance Indicators recommended post-intervention compliance (PIC) of the pathway as a performance indicator. {\textbackslash}par Overview: This project focuses on broadening the scope of the indicators, implementing them for the international passengers pathway, and assessing the effect on prioritization of passenger cohorts for further intervention. {\textbackslash}par Outcomes: – The recommended indicators are: ∗ Before intervention compliance (BIC), ∗ Post-intervention compliance (PIC), ∗ Non-compliance effectiveness (NCE), and ∗ Hit rate (HR). These indicators are simple and robust measures of performance, accounting for compliance and inspectorate performance before and after arrival. – Three of the indicators can be computed with existing data collections, namely BIC, PIC and NCE. HR can be computed for some sub-pathways, but better tracking information is needed, that is, information about all the intervention steps that the passengers have followed. – The data prior to June 2012 were not sufficiently detailed. Collection categories have been amended to enable calculation of all indicators at the desired granularity. – No substantial implications are anticipated for the profiling methodology as a result of adopting these performance measures. With profiling, the categories with the highest approach rate are targeted. The approach remains the same under the new performance measures. – The performance measures can be used to produce new standard reports for monitoring performance. These reports are control charts—as used for statistical process control—but are tailored to DAFF’s operational environment. Importantly, they include confidence intervals to show the uncertainty in each performance indicator. Examples are provided in Chapter 6. {\textbackslash}par Recommendations: – The reported performance indicators should be used to assess how appropriately and how well the inspectorate performs, with PIC as the key indicator (p 23). – Profiles for international passengers and mail articles should still be based on the approach rate (p 24). – Performance indicators should be reported with confidence intervals wherever possible, to enable accurate assessment of the quality of the available information (p 14). – The nominal coverage of the confidence intervals should be no less than 90\% (p 14). – DAFF should determine what would be the effect upon the statistical qualities of the performance indicators of using a sampling approach to counting Incoming Passenger Cards (IPCs) instead of counting all of them (p 21). – DAFF should undertake a further study to determine when and how to cluster small cohorts, and what is the effect upon profiling of that clustering, and what other options—for example, empirical Bayes estimates—might be available for handling small cohorts (p 22). – DAFF should consider whether the cutoff for high-risk cohorts should be the mean approach rate or some higher confidence interval (or, before-intervention compliance, BIC, or lower interval). The mean is the best indicator of compliance, but the higher confidence interval acknowledges that ignorance is a source of risk (p 32). – Leakage surveys need to be representative in order to reduce uncertainty about the compliance of individual cohorts. DAFF should investigate how to assess and report the representativeness of the leakage survey (p 33). – DAFF should review the choice of performance indicators and the data collection procedures within one year (p 23).},

  abstract = {In the passengers and mail import pathways, the Department of Agriculture (Agriculture) seeks to mitigate the inherent biosecurity risk of the pathway by various control measures. These include the profiling and targeted screening of particular cohorts in the pathways. {\textbackslash}par To achieve its goals, Agriculture needs reliable estimates of the inherent risks of the pathways and the cohorts within them, and reliable estimates of the effectiveness of its control measures at reducing those inherent risks. The endpoint survey provides the data required for calculating these estimates. {\textbackslash}par This project reviewed the design, methods and execution of the existing endpoint surveys, and the techniques applied when endpoint survey data are used. We find that the general design of the survey is sound, however there are several issues in its execution that compromise the accuracy of the data collected, the credibility of the data products, and the reputation of the survey process itself. {\textbackslash}par The main issues in the survey’s design and execution are • the target population and sampling frame are not clearly defined • sample selections are biased • inspected or partially inspected passenger baggage is not included in survey inspection • inspection quality is inconsistent • data are sometimes fabricated or censored • not all physical processing streams are represented. {\textbackslash}par The List of Recommendations includes corrective actions that would improve the accuracy and credibility of the cohort profiles and performance indicators produced from survey data. Most of the recommended changes are procedural, carrying minimal if any additional cost.},

  abstract = {1.1 Background Quarantine inspection assists in safeguarding Australia’s biosecurity status by monitoring import pathways for contamination. Once identified, contaminated pathways can be mitigated. Using inspection history to analyse intercepted biosecurity risk is an important process in ensuring that inspection regimes and resourcing match a commodity’s risk profile and pathway failure rate. {\textbackslash}par This project, by the Australian Centre for Excellence in Risk Analysis (ACERA) and Plant Quarantine staff, reviewed the risk–return potential of imported-plant product pathways to optimize the allocation of Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF) inspection resources. Specifically, our goal was to find a way to reduce the amount of inspection without unduly increasing the leakage, defined as the amount of quarantine contamination that passes undetected. This report summarizes the results of a statistical risk analysis of inspection data for plant-product pathways. {\textbackslash}par The target of risk return for imported-plant product pathways is to implement reduced monitoring rates for identified low-risk pathways while still maintaining an acceptably low level of risk of new quarantine incursions, and to allocate the ensuing resources to managing high-risk pathways. Of the 10 pathways examined, 7 were found to be low risk. The resources used to sample these at the border can be partially reallocated to pathways of greater risk. Overall, compliant suppliers will be rewarded and risky pathways will be more adequately addressed. {\textbackslash}par The project team used an evidence-based risk approach, as recommended by Beale et al. (2008), to determine high and low risk based on the inspection failure rate and end use of each pathway. This report documents ACERA project 1001J, which is a pre-cursor to a future project, ACERA Project 1101C, Quarantine Inspection and Auditing Across the Biosecurity Continuum.},

  abstract = {This report follows Robinson et al. (2009) and supersedes Robinson et al. (2010). {\textbackslash}par 1.1 Outcomes We define whole pathway level leakage as the estimated rate of undetected failures across all routine first-port inspections. All statistics are computed using visits to class D ports (defined herein). {\textbackslash}par 1. We estimate the whole pathway level approach rate for contamination to be 4.37\%. {\textbackslash}par 2. We conservatively estimate the whole pathway level leakage following the adoption of Phase 1, as defined in this report, to be 0.42\%. (a) This estimate assumes that inspections are 100\% effective. (b) This estimate is conservative. A better supported estimate is 0.33\%. (c) The estimated whole-pathway rate of contamination that is of biological concern is 0.22\%. (d) The estimate ignores any leakage that corresponds to previously uninspected portions of the pathways (e.g., Bunkers and ship-to-ship transfers). This omission results from inability to distinguish such records in VMS. (e) The estimate is lower than 0.62\%, which was projected by Robinson et al. (2009). The alteration is due to using more data and an improved computation algorithm. (f) This estimate should be compared with 0.17\%, which is the average leakage that was effectively mandated under Increased Quarantine Intervention (IQI)1 . It is more than two times higher than the previously-mandated leakage. (g) We estimate the leakage within the pathways that fall under Phase 1 to be 1.69\%. Leakage that is of biological concern is estimated as 1.11\%. {\textbackslash}par 3. We conservatively predict that the whole pathway level leakage following the adoption of Phase 2, as defined in this report, in addition to Phase 1 will be 0.61\%. (a) This estimate assumes that inspections are 100\% effective. (b) This estimate is conservative. A better supported estimate is 0.47\%. (c) The estimated whole-pathway rate of contamination that is of biological concern is 0.28\%. (d) The estimate ignores any leakage that corresponds to previously uninspected portions of the pathways. (e) We estimate the leakage specific to Phase 2, that is, the leakage specifically within the pathways that fall under Phase 2, to be 0.57\%. Leakage that is of biological concern is estimated as 0.35\%. {\textbackslash}par 4. The increase in risk that results from a reduction in intervention in the routine first-port inspection pathway should be offset by a concomitant increase in intervention in a riskier pathway. Examples of such opportunities include ballast water, biofouling, and validation inspections. {\textbackslash}par 5.
