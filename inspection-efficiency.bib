  abstract = {Background: DAFF has adopted a risk-based approach to managing the biosecurity risk of various pathways, including international passengers and mail. During Increased Quarantine Intervention (IQI), introduced in 2001, inspection effectiveness had been used as the primary indicator of inspectorate performance. A risk-based approach to management requires a richer suite of indicators that will better align with DAFF values. ACERA Project 1001i Performance Indicators recommended post-intervention compliance (PIC) of the pathway as a performance indicator. {\textbackslash}par Overview: This project focuses on broadening the scope of the indicators, implementing them for the international passengers pathway, and assessing the effect on prioritization of passenger cohorts for further intervention. {\textbackslash}par Outcomes: – The recommended indicators are: ∗ Before intervention compliance (BIC), ∗ Post-intervention compliance (PIC), ∗ Non-compliance effectiveness (NCE), and ∗ Hit rate (HR). These indicators are simple and robust measures of performance, accounting for compliance and inspectorate performance before and after arrival. – Three of the indicators can be computed with existing data collections, namely BIC, PIC and NCE. HR can be computed for some sub-pathways, but better tracking information is needed, that is, information about all the intervention steps that the passengers have followed. – The data prior to June 2012 were not sufficiently detailed. Collection categories have been amended to enable calculation of all indicators at the desired granularity. – No substantial implications are anticipated for the profiling methodology as a result of adopting these performance measures. With profiling, the categories with the highest approach rate are targeted. The approach remains the same under the new performance measures. – The performance measures can be used to produce new standard reports for monitoring performance. These reports are control charts—as used for statistical process control—but are tailored to DAFF’s operational environment. Importantly, they include confidence intervals to show the uncertainty in each performance indicator. Examples are provided in Chapter 6. {\textbackslash}par Recommendations: – The reported performance indicators should be used to assess how appropriately and how well the inspectorate performs, with PIC as the key indicator (p 23). – Profiles for international passengers and mail articles should still be based on the approach rate (p 24). – Performance indicators should be reported with confidence intervals wherever possible, to enable accurate assessment of the quality of the available information (p 14). – The nominal coverage of the confidence intervals should be no less than 90\% (p 14). – DAFF should determine what would be the effect upon the statistical qualities of the performance indicators of using a sampling approach to counting Incoming Passenger Cards (IPCs) instead of counting all of them (p 21). – DAFF should undertake a further study to determine when and how to cluster small cohorts, and what is the effect upon profiling of that clustering, and what other options—for example, empirical Bayes estimates—might be available for handling small cohorts (p 22). – DAFF should consider whether the cutoff for high-risk cohorts should be the mean approach rate or some higher confidence interval (or, before-intervention compliance, BIC, or lower interval). The mean is the best indicator of compliance, but the higher confidence interval acknowledges that ignorance is a source of risk (p 32). – Leakage surveys need to be representative in order to reduce uncertainty about the compliance of individual cohorts. DAFF should investigate how to assess and report the representativeness of the leakage survey (p 33). – DAFF should review the choice of performance indicators and the data collection procedures within one year (p 23).},

  abstract = {In the passengers and mail import pathways, the Department of Agriculture (Agriculture) seeks to mitigate the inherent biosecurity risk of the pathway by various control measures. These include the profiling and targeted screening of particular cohorts in the pathways. {\textbackslash}par To achieve its goals, Agriculture needs reliable estimates of the inherent risks of the pathways and the cohorts within them, and reliable estimates of the effectiveness of its control measures at reducing those inherent risks. The endpoint survey provides the data required for calculating these estimates. {\textbackslash}par This project reviewed the design, methods and execution of the existing endpoint surveys, and the techniques applied when endpoint survey data are used. We find that the general design of the survey is sound, however there are several issues in its execution that compromise the accuracy of the data collected, the credibility of the data products, and the reputation of the survey process itself. {\textbackslash}par The main issues in the survey’s design and execution are • the target population and sampling frame are not clearly defined • sample selections are biased • inspected or partially inspected passenger baggage is not included in survey inspection • inspection quality is inconsistent • data are sometimes fabricated or censored • not all physical processing streams are represented. {\textbackslash}par The List of Recommendations includes corrective actions that would improve the accuracy and credibility of the cohort profiles and performance indicators produced from survey data. Most of the recommended changes are procedural, carrying minimal if any additional cost.},

  abstract = {1.1 Background Quarantine inspection assists in safeguarding Australia’s biosecurity status by monitoring import pathways for contamination. Once identified, contaminated pathways can be mitigated. Using inspection history to analyse intercepted biosecurity risk is an important process in ensuring that inspection regimes and resourcing match a commodity’s risk profile and pathway failure rate. {\textbackslash}par This project, by the Australian Centre for Excellence in Risk Analysis (ACERA) and Plant Quarantine staff, reviewed the risk–return potential of imported-plant product pathways to optimize the allocation of Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF) inspection resources. Specifically, our goal was to find a way to reduce the amount of inspection without unduly increasing the leakage, defined as the amount of quarantine contamination that passes undetected. This report summarizes the results of a statistical risk analysis of inspection data for plant-product pathways. {\textbackslash}par The target of risk return for imported-plant product pathways is to implement reduced monitoring rates for identified low-risk pathways while still maintaining an acceptably low level of risk of new quarantine incursions, and to allocate the ensuing resources to managing high-risk pathways. Of the 10 pathways examined, 7 were found to be low risk. The resources used to sample these at the border can be partially reallocated to pathways of greater risk. Overall, compliant suppliers will be rewarded and risky pathways will be more adequately addressed. {\textbackslash}par The project team used an evidence-based risk approach, as recommended by Beale et al. (2008), to determine high and low risk based on the inspection failure rate and end use of each pathway. This report documents ACERA project 1001J, which is a pre-cursor to a future project, ACERA Project 1101C, Quarantine Inspection and Auditing Across the Biosecurity Continuum.},

This omission results from inability to distinguish such records in VMS. (e) The estimate is lower than 0.62\%, which was projected by Robinson et al. (2009). The alteration is due to using more data and an improved computation algorithm.

Previously, CSIRO developed methods to generate tables that report estimates of the risk of the transfer of marine pests by ballast water between Australian ports (ballast water risk tables). {\textbackslash}par Overview: We reviewed the existing workflow for risk table construction and reconstituted the entire construction process within the readily available statistical software environment R. The table generation process was further modularised for ease of use and to allow risk tables to be updated without necessarily running the entire process. {\textbackslash}par Outcomes: We identify under what circumstances risk table updates should occur and how they should be carried out. The new R code was tested by reproducing CSIRO’s previous results for the ballast water risk tables, using the same past input datasets. The new code has been used to produce a revised set of ballast water risk tables using preliminary updated port survey datasets. A key outcome of this project is that ABARES now has a good understanding of the risk table methodology and the code used to generate the risk tables. {\textbackslash}par Recommendations: That ABARES undertake the regular analytical maintenance of the risk tables on behalf of DAFF, with appropriate remuneration from the client Program.},

  abstract = {This report focuses on the inspection of export goods for destination countries that do not specify inspection sampling rates for those goods. Two issues are tackled, namely, (i) what is the appropriate level of sampling for consignments that comprise mixes of products, and (ii) whether there is any scope for the use of compliance-based sampling for inspection of plant products that are to be exported. {\textbackslash}par Part A: Sampling mixed consignments It is possible that the sampling of mixed consignments can be carried out in a way that satisfies Australia’s obligations under the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM) No. 31 (FAO, 2008). • The current policy of allowing the exporter a choice of 600 units or 2\% inspection does not satisfy Australia’s obligations under ISPM 31. – Exporters will most likely choose the least stringent protocol. When 2\% of the total unit count is less than 600 units, an inspection of 2\% does not have a 95\% chance of detecting contamination at a rate of 0.5\% or higher. • Inspection of a simple random sample of 600 units from a mixed consignment does satisfy Australia’s obligations under ISPM 31. – The obligations refer to the consignment, not to the lines within the consignment. – However, if the 600-unit inspection detects contamination then the entire consignment should be rejected. A practice of dropping or replacing a contaminated line does not provide a 95\% chance of detecting contamination of 0.5\% or higher in the un-sampled units. – In order to provide an appropriate level of protection within a system that permits dropping or swapping lines, it would be necessary to (i) verify that cross-contamination cannot have happened, and (ii) inspect 600 different units after dropping / swapping. • Stratification of a mixed consignment into lines, splitting a 600-unit sample proportionally to line volume between the lines, and inspecting a simple random sample from each line to a total of at least 600 units (rounding fractional units up), is a reasonable device to handle the biosecurity risk of mixed consignments. – DAWR should consider using PEMS to monitor the sampling effort devoted to different products, and directing inspection efforts specifically or generally to ensure that reasonably up-todate information about apparently low-risk products is maintained. • Most commonly, the samples taken for inspection are clustered by packaging, e.g., selection of a number of crates of fruit. Such a sample design is called cluster sampling. – A clustered, 600 unit inspection provides a 95\% chance of detecting randomly distributed contamination at a rate of 0.5\% or higher. – A clustered, 600 unit inspection does not provide a 95\% chance of detecting clustered contamination, e.g., contamination that is transmitted by contact within crates, at a rate of 0.5\% or higher. Part B: Compliance-Based Sampling It is unlikely that compliance-based sampling, such as the CSP algorithms employed by Imported Plant Products, can be successfully implemented in the export space. • It would be necessary to collect data at an unprecedented level of detail from each consignment, including, for example, the supplier and geographical region of each line. • Even then it would be necessary to assume that inspection history was in some way continuous within supplier and region, from consignment to consignment. The biological variability of the underlying system mitigates against this assumption.},

  abstract = {The Department of Agriculture and Water Resources (the department) seeks to mitigate the inherent biosecurity risk of various pathways by various control measures. This project involved the deployment of data-mining tools on a collection of data resources held by the department. {\textbackslash}par The overall results of the data mining exercises are very encouraging; in each completed sub-project the tools were able to develop statistically reliable models that produced operationally realistic predictions. Where appropriate, these models have been provided to the department for use in profiling. When the models led to insights that suggest further developments might be called for, these potential developments have been articulated. In the reports for all completed sub-projects, detailed recommendations have been made regarding further data that could be collected to improve modelling as well as the refinements to the modelling should such data be made available. {\textbackslash}par The List of Recommendations includes specific recommendations that arise from the case studies and corrective actions that may improve the accuracy and credibility of decisions arising from analyses of the data. Most of the recommended changes are procedural, carrying minimal if any additional cost. {\textbackslash}par Specific outcomes of the sub-projects are summarized below. {\textbackslash}par 1. Spatial analysis of international mail interceptions. • Aim: to explore the spatial distribution and patterns of the destination address of mail articles seized with biosecurity risk material. • Outcome: spatial patterns of interceptions were identified, and linkages made with information from ABS census data. High-risk demographics were identified, and potential policy remedies discussed. • Next: analysis could include incorporation of mail count data from the Sydney Gateway Facility, and land-use classification for each postcode. It is likely that the techniques used here will also be useful for profiling in the air cargo pathway. {\textbackslash}par 2. Generalised pattern analysis for international passengers. • Aim: to assess the value of Border passenger information for profiling international air passengers to improve inspection efficiency by (i) allowing more timely allocation of inspection resources, and (ii) more accurate profiles using more information than is available on the Incoming Passenger Card. • Outcome: statistical models provide respectable predictive ability of the outcome of passenger inspection based on historical data, but the study suffers several critical shortcomings. • Next: assess the potential benefits and challenges of implementing any outcomes from the study before trying to correct the shortcomings. {\textbackslash}par 3. Detecting anomalous broker activity. • Aim: to outline analyses of the propensity of brokers to amend declarations after receiving quarantine directions of different nature. • Outcome: very little evidence of a link between alterations to import declarations and quarantine directions of different kinds among the brokers assessed in this analysis. Some evidence of alteration of CP risk status from high to low upon direction. • Next: the department should note these results and consider surveillance on items that correspond with amended declarations. {\textbackslash}par 4. Risk factor extraction with VMS. • Aim: to identify risk factors using data from the Vessel Management System (VMS) dataset, in order to be able to predict inspection failure. • Outcome: the aim of determining risk factors for vessels has been achieved with the data available. • Next: improve data capture for vessel agents (75\% missing in dataset) and consider future analysis along comparable lines. {\textbackslash}par 5. Transfer Learning. • Aim: to explore possibilities of sharing information among similar but arguably unalike pathways. • Outcome: this sub-project was withdrawn owing to time and resource constraints. • Next: no further steps at this time. {\textbackslash}par 6. Performance indicators for Cargo Compliance Verification. • Aim: to develop measures that allow reporting compliance across all cargo pathways. • Outcome: Performance measures are developed and reported. • Next: obtain Customs data of all cargo to enable the calculation of key system-wide measures. Produce summaries at the policy level. {\textbackslash}par 7. Analysis of hitch-hikers interception data. • Aim: to test the hypothesis that the arrival of specific hitchhiker pests on imported cargo can be anticipated based on pest biology and known distribution. • Outcome: this sub-project was withdrawn as insufficient interception data were available, and those data that were available were of inadequate quality. • Next: the department should identify and remedy the gaps in data capture and curation that undermined the successful prosecution of this study.},

  abstract = {Background: Previous collaborative ACERA/DAFF work has identified a suite of imported plant-product pathways that could be managed with a risk-based approach using statistical tools such as the Continuous Sampling Plan, CSP. {\textbackslash}par Overview: This project extends the earlier work by developing statistical tools that will enable automated identification of risky and safe pathways, and pathways with characteristics or patterns that might provide a good match for CSP. We studied fresh and dried dates, medium-risk nursery stock (MRNS), and mediumrisk plant-based stockfeed (PBS). {\textbackslash}par Outcomes: The inspection of fresh as well as dried dates can be managed using the CSP–3 tool under the single tariff for dates, splitting the pathway by importer. There is considerable variation between the regions on the rate at which contamination is detected within the MRNS pathway. Altering the cutoff number of contaminated plants that constitutes a quarantine failure in MRNS has a minimal effect upon the pathway-level contamination rate, and further consideration is not justified. Analyzing the patterns of contamination in PBS is very challenging because it has so far proved impossible to develop an inspection database owing to the lack of a definitive identifier for the pathway. Several pathways in the fruit tariff chapter are identified as low or high risk by use of simple data mining tools. {\textbackslash}par Recommendations: Rather than attempting to develop and support the analytical skills required to maintain and update CSP–3 inspection algorithms and data-mining activities, the pathway manager should seek support from a provider such as ABARES. Use CSP for risk-based management of all consignments entering under the dates tariff, whether fresh or dried, splitting the pathway by importer. For other pathways being assessed for CSP, DAFF should consider splitting the pathways by importer. Continue data-mining activities on fruit inspection data (presently underway as ACERA Project 1206F). Improve border data capture of permit data for PBS.},

  abstract = {Many different plant-based products are imported into Australia. Some of these products may present a biosecurity risk to Australia because they contain biosecurity risk material (BRM; insects, pathogens, contamination, etc). Hence, these products are subjected to various quarantine interventions, ranging from documentary assessments to mandatory on-arrival inspections. These interventions are designed to reduce the likelihood of entry of BRM that could have undesirable impacts in Australia. {\textbackslash}par Imports are managed by considering plant import “pathways”. Pathways are defined by the Department of Agriculture (DA) pathway manager, and can be any grouping of imported products, for example “raisins”. Grouping may also relate to things like individual importers, or countries of origin. The overall biosecurity risk presented by a plant import pathway is determined by the likelihood of arrival of BRM in an import, and the severity of possible impact of that BRM. Current intervention strategies do not necessarily reflect this risk, and the department is changing pathway management strategies as part of the biosecurity reform agenda arising from the Beale review [1]. The current biosecurity reform process includes the implementation of a risk-based approach to biosecurity, to minimise the risk to Australia for a given level of investment (risk-return). Moving resources from areas where risk is relatively low and focusing these resources in areas where more substantial reductions in risk could be achieved, would contribute to this. In this report we extend earlier ACERA work [2, 3] and focus on two broad areas designed to deal more appropriately with biosecurity risk, namely Continuous Sampling Plans (CSPs; described below) and data mining. {\textbackslash}par Broadly speaking the project comprised four themes: (i) comparison of CSP alternatives using a new criterion, namely “inspections per detection” (IPD: the average number of import inspections carried out to detect an import containing BRM), and more explicit consideration of existing criteria such as leakage (leakage refers to the number of imports containing BRM missed over some time period of interest, hence entering the post-border area of Australia); (ii) the implications of applying a CSP to manage a “combined” pathway (e.g. “nuts”) as opposed to component pathways (e.g. almonds, cashews, walnuts, etc); (iii) investigating the role of data mining for identifying high-risk components of pathways; and (iv) using and building on internal capacity within the department (ABARES) to facilitate the uptake of the outcomes of this work. {\textbackslash}par Criteria for assessing a Continuous Sampling Plan CSPs monitor pathways by switching between modes of random inspection, where a proportion of imports are inspected, and enhanced inspection, where a consecutive number of imports are inspected. These are referred to as CSP rates. Switching between modes depends on the outcomes from recent inspections of imports on a pathway. CSPs are being considered as a way of monitoring low-risk pathways that have a low proportion of imports containing BRM, and where the BRM on the pathway is not likely to have severe impact, either because of the material itself, or because of the post-entry use of the product in Australia. Earlier work by ACERA indicated that if a pathway was stratified by suppliers (for example), with a CSP applied independently to each individual supplier (but using the same CSP rates for each one), then with the same overall effort more BRM could be detected using a CSP compared with just random sampling of each supplier. {\textbackslash}par Different CSP rates and different stratifications (e.g. importers, suppliers) produce different overall inspection outcomes. Earlier work focussed on Post Intervention Compliance (PIC; the proportion of consignments that are compliant after applying an inspection regime) as the main performance/selection criterion for pathway managers to use when deciding which rates to adopt. In this report we focus more attention on absolute leakage, which is determined jointly by compliance rate (the proportion of imports that don’t contain BRM) and pathway volume (the number of imports over some time period of interest). Absolute leakage better reflects biosecurity risk to Australia. Once a level of acceptable absolute leakage is chosen (say for example 3 BRM in a year on a particular pathway), IPD can be used to determine the most efficient inspection strategy to achieve this level of leakage. This is consistent with the new risk-return approach in the department. {\textbackslash}par The different pathways analysed in this report present different tradeoffs in IPD and leakage. Some show little variation in leakage as a function of different CSP rates, but substantial variation in IPD, meaning that substantial reductions in IPD can be achieved without a large increase in leakage. In contrast, others show substantial variation in leakage with limited variation in IPD, making the decision on CSP rates more difficult. Determining the preferred strategy for any particular pathway will require analysis of that pathway. We provide a full set of tables and associated figures for each pathway considered in this report (raisins, cashews, dried apricots, green coffee beans, hulled sesame seeds, and dried dates) so that pathway managers can consider the potential tradeoffs between different CSP designs. {\textbackslash}par Applying a CSP to a combined pathway To date, CSPs have been applied to component pathways, but there may be administrative and resourcing benefits of applying them to combined pathways. In this report we explore the implications of combining pathways for the CSP selection criteria used to determine CSP sampling rates (enhanced and random inspection rates). If CSPs are being considered for a combined pathway, then all component pathways should satisfy the definition of low risk given above. In this report we analyse the “nut” pathway as an example, but point out that the decision about whether component pathways for nuts are low risk has not been made at this stage. {\textbackslash}par In this example case, the analysis showed that treating nuts as one pathway for both estimating and applying CSP rates produced the lowest IPD, but at the expense of higher leakage, compared with choosing and applying rates for the lowest IPD for each individual pathway. This approach needs to be investigated further with other pathways, and consideration should be given to other pros and cons of combining pathways, as opposed to treating them separately, when considering the operational usefulness of this approach. For example, we may ask: are failure types likely to be specific to individual nut types? in which case perhaps they should be separated. {\textbackslash}par Data mining to identify factors associated with risk In past projects data mining has been used to identify pathways that may be suitable for CSP monitoring, for example, those with low proportions of BRM. Alternatively, data mining could be used to identify factors associated with higher risk on a pathway. It could be used for example to focus inspection effort on a pathway as one way to improve inspection effectiveness (the ability of an individual inspection to find BRM). In this project we applied to the nut data a new data mining method called group OSCAR, and an existing method known as random forests, as a trial of data mining methods for plant import data. The data mining was constrained by our computer infrastructure (see below), but results suggested that nut type (almond, cashew, etc) was not a strong predictor of risk, relative to the higher risk associated with suppliers, importers or countries. Higher risk importers/suppliers/countries tended to have low numbers of imports. These types of importers/suppliers/countries would be detected by the initial enhanced inspection applied in a CSP, depending on what stratification the CSP was focussed on. Future work on data mining would benefit from considering pathways with higher proportions of BRM, and a broader range of potential pathway attributes that could be associated with BRM. {\textbackslash}par Building and using capacity with the department This project built a strong collaboration between ACERA, the quantitative sciences section in ABARES (DA), and Plant Import Operations, Plant Biosecurity Division (DA). Capacity to carry out future CSP and data mining analyses has been developed in the department, and the research outcomes from the project have been enhanced by including scientists from the department directly in the research and analysis. This approach provides one model for improving both the uptake and outcomes of research and development. {\textbackslash}par Other issues The CSP rates are chosen based on simulation of data that comes from mandatory inspection of a pathway, hence simulated performance assumes the pathway continues to behave in a similar way. Once a CSP is implemented, the inspection history will come from the subset of the import pathway inspected according to the CSP rules and rates applied to the pathway. It is essential that methods are developed to determine (i) whether the proportion of BRM on the pathway deviates from the original data; (ii) how long it takes to detect deviation and the implications that has for risk; and (iii) how CSP rates can be updated to reflect changes in the proportion of BRM on a pathway. Future work should address these questions. {\textbackslash}par Computer hardware and software available for this project limited some of the analyses. Data mining in particular was constrained by this, but the CSP computer simulation would also benefit if its speed could be increased.},

  abstract = {Background: DAFF is moving towards a risk-based approach to managing the biosecurity risk of various pathways. DAFF requires and issues an import permit for the importation of certain bulk products, for example, medium-risk plant-based stockfeed (PBS). An audit is undertaken of the importing company before an import permit can be permitted. The audits are of varying intensity, ranging from desk audits to site visits. In a risk-based intervention setting, the outcomes of audits might be useful for targeting border inspection efforts, and the results of border inspections could be used to guide audit frequency. {\textbackslash}par Overview: The goal of this study was to determine what the effect is of border inspection outcomes upon audit outcomes and the effect of the outcomes of audits on border inspection results, for PBS. In other words, the goal was to ask whether there is a feedback loop between offshore and border risk mitigation strategies. {\textbackslash}par The goal could not be achieved: the inspection outcomes could not be reliably linked to the audit data due to incomplete data capture at the border; the import permit number was commonly omitted or misrecorded. The project scope was changed to comprise an assessment of a proposed off-shore sampling regime (reported as Outcome 2). {\textbackslash}par Outcomes: 1. With the current data holdings, data capture policies, and offshore risk management strategies in place, connecting the outcomes of audits and border inspections in such a way that statistically reliable information can be obtained is a prohibtively cumbersome task (p. 12). 2. Certified, third-party offshore sampling of bulk-shipped PBS is safer and more efficient than the within-QAP bulk inspection (p. 22).},

  url = {https://cebra.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/2383453/1301C-Final-Report.pdf},
  abstract = {To estimate and manage the likelihood of transferring marine pests within Australia, CSIRO and the Department of Agriculture (formerly the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) developed the Australian ballast water risk assessment (hereafter called the BWRA). The original system was endorsed by the National Introduced Marine Pests Coordination Group. Current decisions on the system are now made by the Marine Pest Sectoral Committee (MPSC). {\textbackslash}par The BWRA is a modular, species-specific system that estimates the likelihood that a species could be taken up from one Australian port, transported to another Australian port and successfully complete its lifecycle there, for any given month in the year. The intent of the system is that when likelihood of a successful transfer is high, the vessel needs to exchange its ballast water before arriving in the recipient port. Currently 129 ports and seven species (Asterias amurensis - Northern Pacific Seastar, Carcinus maenas - European Green Crab, Varicorbula gibba - European Clam, Musculista senhousia - Asian Date or Bag Mussel, Sabella spallanzani - European Featherduster Worm, Undaria pinnatifida - Japanese Seaweed or Wakame, and Crassostrea gigas - Pacific Oyster) are considered in the system. {\textbackslash}par The original version of the BWRA was constructed using a combination of code written for the open-source statistical environment R and Visual Basic in Microsoft Excel. The process was unnecessarily complicated by the need to move repeatedly between these two programs, and made code maintenance potentially difficult or expensive. In addition, the temperature tolerances for the species life-stages were embedded within the R code, which made updating difficult. {\textbackslash}par In a recent ACERA project (1004E), the table construction process was updated to allow the entire analytical process to occur within R. Microsoft Excel is now used only for the storage of input data and results. The code was modified to allow temperature tolerance data for the species of concern to be stored in an Excel worksheet, instead of being ‘hard-wired’ within the R code, and hence relatively inaccessible. The table generation process was further modularised for ease of use, and to allow risk tables to be updated without necessarily running full code within each module. During that project some problems with the underlying methodology for module D were identified, which have implications for estimating likelihood. In this project we explore these problems and identify solutions. {\textbackslash}par A critical component of the risk assessment is estimating whether species are likely to be able to complete their lifecycle if introduced to a port by (1) simulating progression through lifecycles for select ports in response to sea (and in some cases air) temperatures, where SeaFRAME (Sea level Fine Resolution Acoustic Measuring Equipment) temperature data are available; and (2) using the results from the simulation models to develop statistical models that relate lifecycle completion to latitude, and then using the statistical models to predict lifecycle completion for the other ports. In the recent project problems were identified with the generation of synthetic air and sea temperature data (derived from SeaFRAME data), and with the interpretation of risk from the species lifecycle simulations. {\textbackslash}par Generating synthetic air and sea temperature data In the original version of the BWRA, sea temperature simulations were generated in such a way that substantially different estimates of lifecycle completion for species introduced on 31 December vs. 1 January could occur, which is clearly unreasonable. The original approach also had limitations when considering between-year variation in sea temperatures. To address this we used a technique known as a block bootstrap, with time series constructed by randomly selecting from the yearly blocks with replacement. We modelled the minimum daily temperature and the difference between the minimum and maximum daily temperature, with the maximum daily temperature simulated based on the simulated minimums plus the simulated differences. This ensures that maximum daily temperature is always greater than the minimum daily temperature. This approach ensures that year to year variation in temperatures is included in the simulations and that lifecycle simulation outcomes are similar for introductions on 31 December vs. 1 January. {\textbackslash}par Estimating likelihood from lifecycle models In the original version of the BWRA, likelihood of survival was based on a species completing on average 80\% of its lifecycle, given introduction in a particular month. It was argued that this cutoff reflected a good tradeoff between the “comfort and environmental protection provided by a low level, against the benefits and better risk resolution provided by a high level.” Put another way, the argument was that if a species completes on average less than 80\% of its lifecycle, then the likelihood of survival is low because it’s not getting close to the end of its lifecycle. However, there is more that one way this average can result from simulations. From 1000 simulations an 80\% average could be obtained because all the simulations give a percentage lifecycle completed of around 80\%, or it could be obtained because in 800 simulations the species completes all of its lifecycle and in 200 simulations it completes none of its lifecycle. This type of result was common for many of the species’ lifecycle simulations. The interpretation of likelihood from these two different scenarios is completely different, despite the fact the mean proportion of lifecycle completed is the same. In the latter case, using the mean, we would be concluding that a species that completed all of its lifecycle in 800 of 1000 simulations was on the border of being considered low likelihood; this is clearly not the case. {\textbackslash}par To address this, the MPSC has agreed to use as a criterion the proportion of simulations for which 100\% of the lifecycle is completed. This still requires a cutoff above which survival is considered ‘likely’. In the absence of detailed empirical information on what this cutoff should be, the decision at present is to use a 0.05 cutoff and to covert the metric to a monthly value by assuming that if the proportion of simulations on any day within a month exceeds 0.05, then that month will be considered risky for survival of the pest should it arrive. While other processes contribute to the probability of establishment, lifecycle completion is taken as a risk-averse proxy for establishment in the absence of any good quantitative evidence for the magnitude of effect of these other processes. For many species/port combinations, the new method increases the number of months in which lifecycle completion is considered likely. In this report we show the implications of choosing this cutoff for each simulated port and compare this with the old rule. {\textbackslash}par Future developments It can be questioned whether it is appropriate to generalise lifecycle completion results to ports where sea surface temperature data are not available based on results at the 13 ports with SeaFRAME data. Generalising against latitude has obvious problems because it can only reliably describe very broad patterns in sea surface temperature; it does not take into account local conditions or ocean currents, which differ for example between the east and west coasts. One approach to address these problems would be to use satellite-derived sea surface temperature data as the raw data for simulation modelling at every port, removing the need to generalise using just latitude. These data would also provide more insights into the spatial variation in temperature throughout a port. {\textbackslash}par Any cutoff based solely on the lifecycle simulations would be arbitrary, but fits with the decision being made because decisions apply to the arrival of individual vessels. However, the probability a pest will establish in a port over a given time period is actually determined by probability of establishment given arrival (from one vessel), in combination with the number of journeys carrying the pest arriving over that time period. Cutoffs could be developed that take account of the number of transits between ports. {\textbackslash}par Recommendations We recommend that the Department of Agriculture: • Notes that the MPSC has endorsed the new method for generating sea surface temperatures. • Notes that the MPSC has endorsed defining the monthly yes/no decision point for acceptable risk of introduction to: full lifecycle being completed in 5\% of simulations on any day in a month. • Considers developing a method based on satellite-derived sea surface temperature data to generate data for simulation modelling at every port. • Considers developing a method for determine a risk cutoff that incorporates the number of transits between ports.},

  abstract = {The development of methods to quantitatively assess whether steps in production and pre-export practices reduce phytosanitary risks presents a significant opportunity to build the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources (the department’s) risk pro5 filing capacity, and tailor biosecurity risk management activities to target intervention within individual import pathways. {\textbackslash}par The department is seeking to change pathway management strategies to better reflect biosecurity risk, and as part of this project requested consideration of the: • Understanding of critical hazards/control points of a biosecurity import system and contribution to reducing biosecurity risk; • Data collection requirements of such a system; and • A way to risk-profile entities based on actions that they undertake offshore. {\textbackslash}par In this report, we focus on offshore fumigation of fresh garlic and oranges, and discuss insurmountable issues analysing intervention data for coconuts. {\textbackslash}par As a matter of policy, all fresh garlic imports are inspected on arrival, regardless of whether offshore fumigation is performed. In the time period covered by the data that were available to us, slightly less than half of fresh garlic consignments were fumigated offshore. Offshore fumigation reduced the contamination rate of live insects by about 59\%, compared with consignments that were not fumigated. Similarly, for orange imports, offshore fumigation reduced the contamination rate by about 67\%. Whilst the reductions in contamination rates were relatively high, it appears that the offshore treatments on these two pathways were not able to reduce the phytosanitory risks to acceptable levels: the contamination rates for those offshore treated fresh garlic and orange imports were about 9\% and 34\%, respectively. {\textbackslash}par For inspection data of consignments of fresh garlic that had been treated offshore, analysis with a Bayesian logistic model suggested that varying the concentration of methyl bromide applied did not result in statistically significant differences in contamination rates. Our analysis also suggested that there were no statistically significant differences between the outcomes of treatments provided by the fumigation providers. {\textbackslash}par A major bottleneck to analysis was the lack of available data in a computer accessible format. Some of the difficulties uncovered were: • The lack of a clear and direct link between department databases; • The storage of critical control point information in formats not amenable to numerical analysis (e.g., scanned phytosanitary certificates); and • The difficulty in deciphering the provenance of some quarantine directives. For example, it was sometimes unclear whether fumigation was performed because insect contamination had been detected or because of a mandatory fumigation requirement. {\textbackslash}par These issues were exemplified in the case study on the import of (fresh and dried) coconuts, within which incorrect conclusions from analyses could be made primarily because of data provenance issues. {\textbackslash}par The timing of fumigation directions and treatments was clarified in the case studies on imports of fresh garlic and oranges. However, the analysis was time-consuming due to the requirement to manually extract information from phytosanitary certificates before analysis. Furthermore, many phytosanitary certificates were illegible, an issue for both this analysis and for any back-tracing that may be required for investigation. {\textbackslash}par This report provides material evidence that obtaining the data to help manage biosecurity risk will be simplified and improved by linking the department’s databases. Furthermore, control-point data, especially phytosanitary certificates, should be captured electronically in a consistent database format, for the purposes of better understanding the impacts of critical control points of an import pathway.},

  abstract = {This report forms part of the evidence base to support the Commonwealth Government Department of Agriculture and Water Resources (the department) in reforming the design and implementation of Australia’s regulatory framework for biosecurity assurance. It builds on the findings of CEBRA Project 1304C: Incentives for Importer Choices (Rossiter et al., 2016), which developed proposals for regulatory frameworks that could provide appropriate incentives for participants to reduce the likelihood of biosecurity risk material entering Australia. CEBRA Project 1404C tests the appropriateness of candidate mechanisms and scopes alternative approaches to the way they are implemented using a series of economic experiments conducted with university students in a computer laboratory. {\textbackslash}par Much of the department’s focus on resource allocation in the context of biosecurity risk management, including the Risk-Return Resource Allocation model, does not formally incorporate or model the likely response of stakeholders (e.g. importers and suppliers) to changes in biosecurity control strategies employed by the department. Recent investigations in Rossiter et al. (2016) and Rossiter and Hester (2017), however, highlight that departmental assessments of biosecurity control strategies need to take these behavioural responses into account. This is because, under some circumstances, the incentive structures inherent in certain processes and strategies could encourage stakeholders to behave very differently under new protocols, relative to the established ones. {\textbackslash}par Imposing regulatory changes without carefully considering stakeholder responses could introduce inappropriate incentive structures for compliance and deliver unintended policy consequences, potentially undermining the maintenance of Australia’s high biosecurity status. In this context, the experiments conducted in this project are novel because their focus is on the behaviour of stakeholders, namely importers, in response to different protocols applied by a biosecurity regulator. In turn, this provides a complementary, but distinct, approach to guide how trade-offs associated with meeting the department’s biosecurity policy objectives could be managed. {\textbackslash}par This report documents the design and results from the experiments, where experimental subjects (students) assumed the role of importers and were required to make choices about their supplier over time. The experiments sought to mimic the interactions between the department and importers relating to biosecurity inspections. Rather than testing all aspects of importer decision-making under different candidate rules, the experiments examined particular aspects of the rules likely to be more difficult to assess in the field. The experimental treatments tested were constructed to inform the department about implementing compliance-based protocols and identify how current practices may be fine-tuned to better support departmental objectives. {\textbackslash}par The project investigated how the following aspects affect an importer’s choice of supplier: i. different inspection rules from the continuous sampling plan (CSP) family; ii. the level of information provided to stakeholders about the inspection rule; iii. feedback on an importer’s performance under the inspection rule; iv. costs of being inspected and of failing inspection; v. allowing rule-choice from a limited set of options; and vi. an importer’s understanding of the rule.},

  abstract = {The introduction of the Biosecurity Act (2015) means that as of 8 September 2017 when the act comes into force, all vessels, on both international and domestic voyages, will be required to manage their ballast water. To estimate and manage the likelihood of transferring marine pests within Australia, CSIRO and the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources (formerly the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) developed the Australian ballast water risk assessment (hereafter called the BWRA). The original system was endorsed by the National Introduced Marine Pests Coordination Group and updates have been endorsed by the Marine Pest Sectoral Committee (MPSC). {\textbackslash}par The BWRA is a modular, species-specific system that estimates the likelihood that a species could be taken up from one Australian port, transported to another Australian port and successfully complete its lifecycle there, for any given month in the year. The intent of the system is that when likelihood of a successful transfer is high, the vessel needs to manage its ballast water before arriving in the recipient port. Currently 129 ports and seven species (Asterias amurensis - northern Pacific seastar, Carcinus maenas - European green crab, Varicorbula gibba - European clam, Musculista senhousia - Asian date or bag mussel, Sabella spallanzani - European featherduster worm, Undaria pinnatifida - Japanese seaweed or wakame, and Crassostrea gigas - Pacific oyster) are the only species included in the system. {\textbackslash}par Life cycle simulation modelling A critical component of the BWRA is the simulation of species’ life cycles based on daily sea water temperature. The data underpinning these simulations are extracted from the Bureau of Meteorology’s (BoM) SeaFRAME (Sea level Fine Resolution Acoustic Measuring Equipment) tide gauge array for monitoring long period sea level changes. The array comprises 16 tide gauges, but data from only 13 are currently used in the BWRA. Statistical modelling of at least ten years of daily data is used to generate 1000 synthetic temperature time series for each SeaFRAME location and these are then used to simulate species lifecycles. One thousand synthetic temperature time series, combined with uncertainty in species temperature tolerances, lead to estimates of the proportion of simulations in which lifecycle is completed, for each of the target pest species in each of the SeaFRAME locations, given introduction to the location as larvae on each day of the year. For the risk tables these are then expressed as the proportion of simulations completed, given introduction in each month of the year. Life cycle completion for all the other ports in Australia is estimated from statistical models that relate simulated life cycle completion in tide gauge ports to latitude. In this report we investigate whether sea surface temperature data derived from satellites would be a better source of data than those from the tide gauges. {\textbackslash}par We found that the SeaFRAME tide gauge temperature data and satellite sea surface temperature (SST) data from the areas around the tide gauges were similar at most locations. Where the results differed, for example at Hilarys, a logical explanation was invariably possible, in this case that the location of the tide gauge inside an enclosed marina resulted in warmer temperatures in summer and cooler temperatures in winter due to reduced circulation and mixing with the open ocean, though this explanation has not been tested. The different data sets can produce different results for life cycle simulations when species temperature tolerances that underpin the life cycle models fall near the maximum or minimum water temperature recorded. It should be noted, though, that comparisons were only carried out for tide gauge locations. More substantial changes may be seen when the life cycle simulations that are currently extrapolated to distant ports using latitude as the analogue for temperature are replaced with satellite sea surface temperature (SST) data from the areas around the ports. {\textbackslash}par There is currently no understanding of which (if either) data source, properly captures the full range of temperatures experienced by marine species in any given port environment. Similarly, our understanding of the temperature tolerance ranges of invasive marine species and the effect of other factors such as salinity, disturbance and propagule pressure is far from complete. Both temperature data sources can probably be considered reasonable representations of the general temperatures experienced by marine species in ports. Both data sources have their advantages and disadvantages: the tide gauge data may be more accurate at the point at which it is recorded, but SST data may capture the range of temperatures in the environment around a port better. SST has a considerable advantage in that it covers the entire coastline, including in or near every port in Australia, which obviates the need to use the statistical models to interpolate lifecycle completion to the majority of ports based on latitude. On this basis, we recommend that SeaFRAME tide gauge temperature data be replaced with SST data as the data source for the BWRA risk tables. {\textbackslash}par Regardless of whether the BWRA is to adopt satellite SST as the data source underpinning the simulation models, the list of ports in the tables should be revised and reduced from the current 129 to a number that more accurately reflects the ports likely to receive discharged ballast water, including clusters of ports. If satellite SST data is adopted for the BWRA there are a number of technical issues regarding data access that will need to be resolved with the Department’s IT systems. {\textbackslash}par Vessel voyages and risk The current BWRA determines the risk of translocation for individual movements between one point and another, to determine whether ballast exchange is required. However, the overall risk of translocation is likely to incorporate the amount and type of traffic that undertakes particular voyages. We explore the use of vessel movement data for assessing the cumulative risk of establishment, and hence for identifying locations where resources would best be targeted for compliance and pest monitoring activities. {\textbackslash}par We found that Lloyds data are useful for determining how many voyages have occurred by vessels that could have been carrying bulk ballast water. However, the value of the data is limited because the data do not clearly identify whether any particular voyage was undertaken in ballast or with cargo. No data sets were identified that provide an easy and reliable way of determining this. In the future a more comprehensive data set that identifies the number of domestic voyages carrying large amounts of ballast water that requires discharge could be obtained from administration of the BWRA system. We recommend that any administrative system developed is designed to ensure comprehensive and accurate capture of these data. {\textbackslash}par Summary of recommendations • That SeaFRAME tide gauge temperature data be replaced with satellite sea surface temperature data as the data source for the BWRA risk tables. • That research be carried out to obtain empirical evidence that provides insight into how well the life cycle models represent actual risk. • That the list of ports be revised to remove those ports where ballast-water carrying vessels in the Type A category do not currently visit and to remove duplicates. • That the temperature tolerances of the species in the BWRA system be revised and updated. • That systems be developed to access sub-sets of SST data on IMOS’ system remotely using a protocol like OPeNDAP. • That systems be developed as part of the BWRA to capture data on domestic voyages carrying large amounts of ballast water requiring discharge.},

  abstract = {This report summarises the development of the on-arrival ornamental fish health monitoring system. The system is central to the Department of Agriculture (the department)’s ornamental fish import reform project, under which the department proposes to change the way it manages the biosecurity risks associated with the importation of ornamental fish into Australia. {\textbackslash}par The ACERA II 1206G Ornamental Finfish Import Reform Program developed a sampling framework and trial for the surveillance program that focused on trialing the operational feasibility of the monitoring system using non-compliant bags only (Phase 1). The data generated from Phase 1 testing are analysed in this report. Australian Import Management System (AIMS) data for all ornamental fish consignments for a 12 month period were analysed to provide a snapshot of activity for various pathways. A pathway is defined as all consignments in a particular risk group of fish imported by an importer and supplied by an exporter. The findings of these analyses are proved in this report. {\textbackslash}par This report also describes the proposed design of the next trial (Phase 2) of the fish health monitoring system. This trial has two components: A. Sampling, processing and testing of fish from compliant fish bags, i.e. bags of imported ornamental fish that on inspection are determined to be visually healthy. B. Sampling, processing and testing of fish from non-compliant fish bags, namely bags of imported ornamental fish that on inspection are determined to be associated with substantial signs of communicable disease. {\textbackslash}par For compliant bags, CEBRA proposes the use of sampling algorithm from the Continuous Sampling Plan (CSP) family. Similar algorithms have already been trialed for several imported plant-products. Each pathway is assigned to an ‘enhanced’ mode (a higher frequency of sampling) or ‘monitoring’ mode (a lower frequency of sampling), depending on the history of compliances of that pathway. The sampling framework will be effected through a dashboard, a spreadsheet-based program, developed by the department, which is linked to AIMS. The dashboard will automatically consider each imported consignment in the context of the pathway it represents and direct departmental officers to sample fish, based on a CSP algorithm specifically designed for ornamental fish. {\textbackslash}par For non-compliant bags, there is the need to develop definitions of non-compliance for inspectors, and a histological index that standardises the reporting of laboratories’ findings. This involves estimating disease levels associated with the occurrence of different kind of gross symptoms and histopathological observations. The main objective of this component of the monitoring system is to better identify emerging disease risks. CEBRA proposes to use an expert elicitation methodology to develop a definition of non-compliance and to develop the histological index. {\textbackslash}par It is recommended that the department and CEBRA continue to fine tune the fish monitoring system including the analysis of Phase 2 data, possibly expanding the scope of the trials and holding workshops to broaden the basis of the expert elicitations.},

  abstract = {New Zealand has a highly valued and internationally respected seed growing and seed export industry due to its disease-free status and the ability to provide additional growing seasons for Northern Hemisphere producers. The success of the industry is dependent on the ability to import seed of a wide variety of species and from different production areas. The Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) is responsible for managing the biosecurity risks associated with seed imports which includes the importation of high value seeds as small seed lots. {\textbackslash}par At present the only option available for seed importers of small seed lots (under 2500 seeds) wishing to import into New Zealand, is to source the seed from countries that are declared free from the regulated diseases listed in the Import Health Standard (IHS) 155.02.05: Seeds for Sowing [8]. This requirement limits the number of countries/suppliers that are eligible to supply the various commodities. {\textbackslash}par In order to maximise the sustainability and growth of the New Zealand seed export industry, an alternative seed testing protocol designed specifically for importing small seed lots is required. The sampling protocol must be flexible enough to help facilitate frequent imports of different volumes of seeds, species, and various geographic locations. {\textbackslash}par In this report, we provide a detailed discussion on an approach which may be used to manage the pathway-level risk of contaminated seed being imported into New Zealand. In any system reliant on sampling to detect contamination, contaminated product may be missed and subsequently imported; this is known as leakage. The proposed approach that we detail provides, at a minimum, an architecture for interrogating the effect of such leakage. In particular, we show the impacts of lot size on possible leakage rates. Further, the approach that we detail may be used alongside detailed pest risk analyses to determine an acceptable leakage rate for a pathway, and subsequently provide a mechanism for calculating a sample size required for testing on a lot-by-lot basis. The system that we detail thus manages the whole-of-pathway risk, rather than the risk on an individual lot basis, as per the current system. {\textbackslash}par Additionally, this report provides a summary of the relevant methods that are described in the International standards for phytosanitary measures: ISPM 31, methodologies for sampling of consignments [5] for calculating sample sizes in relatively small lots. Whilst we acknowledge that the New Zealand’s Ministry for Primary Industries already has such a methodology at its disposal, we use this report to stress its importance, and further provide an example software application that can be tailored to MPI’s specific import requirements. {\textbackslash}par The full list of recommendations from this report are provided in the List of Recommendations, however at a minimum we suggest that MPI continue to utilise and expand upon the ISPM 31 methodology (which uses the Hypergeometric distribution) of sample size calculation for imports of small seed lots. We also suggest that consideration be made into the effects of leaked contaminated seed, and that the novel approach of controlling such leakage be entertained as a way to manage pathway-level risk of seeds for sowing.},
