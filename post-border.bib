  abstract = {A wide range of tools and methodologies that are available to prove the pest or disease status of a country or region was reviewed in ACERA 1004. The review highlighted the set of tools that could be used to achieve or maintain market access. Most were used for ‘proof of freedom’ claims and were classified as relating to either survey design or to scenario-tree modelling, however, not all of these have been developed into readily applicable tools that could be easily and accurately applied by biosecurity managers with limited prior knowledge of the methodology. In this document we have detailed three survey design tools that have been developed from accepted statistical formulae and are well accepted in animal-disease surveillance: FreeCalc; EpiTools; and Survey Toolbox. We recommend that EpiTools be chosen for undertaking survey design and analysis. {\textbackslash}textbackslashpar After additional investigation into scenario tree modeling (including Bayesian Belief Networks) and associated generic software, the authors deem that this method requires too much prior knowledge and is not sufficiently clear that biosecurity managers or scientific staff could be reasonably expected to use and master it quickly. It appears unlikely that a tool will ever be developed that can effectively replace the amount of training that would be required to master scenariotree modeling. If scenario-tree modeling were required to make a proof-of-freedom claim, then it would be advisable to employ an expert who has had training in the use of this methodology, to undertake the analysis.},

  abstract = {This report presents a technical development. This development is important because it simplifies some recent advances in scenario tree techniques that are being used increasingly, especially in animal disease management, to substantiate claims of disease freedom. Scenario trees are a new and popular method by which surveillance systems can be evaluated. One of their limitations is that for relatively complicated systems, such as surveillance systems for animal diseases that use multiple sources of information, the scenario trees can become large and complex. This report demonstrates how to simplify large scenario trees by ‘pruning’ redundant branches. It also shows that in many situations, scenario trees can be presented as Bayesian networks, thereby taking advantage of a considerable body of knowledge, software and expertise for building and testing systems that support claims of disease freedom.},

Early detection of, and a rapid, effective response to such diseases have a large impact on limiting the economic damage caused by epidemics. {\textbackslash}par An acknowledged weakness of biosecurity preparedness and response to agricultural diseases in both countries is the lack of a single source of accurate, up-to-date farm livestock demographics information. This report reviews the use of animal counts for investigation of, preparedness for and response to exotic animal disease outbreaks, and analyses the available New Zealand datasets in depth. Gaps and weaknesses in the current data landscape are documented. The project objectives then focus on developing methodologies to estimate national-level farm demographic data and assess the use of modelled and inaccurate data in disease simulation models.

These were reviewed in Stages 1 and 2 of this project. Many of the tools and methods discussed in the review are, however, not easily applied by those involved in post-border surveillance due to both the complexity of the tools and time constraints on surveillance staff. {\textbackslash}par Previous milestone reports outlined two case studies that illustrate the application of two of these tools (Stage 3), and described their implementation in ways that would make them accessible to operational staff in Australian government agencies (Stage 4). The purpose of this report is to describe field tests of the tools, recommendations for modifications and developments to suit operational conditions, and (for case study ii) the test version of the software (Project Stage 5). {\textbackslash}par In summary, the two case studies explain: i. the use of EpiTools (a set of web-based tools) to create a survey strategy for demonstration of freedom from citrus canker in the Northern Territory; and ii. the use of an Excel-based eradograph-monitoring tool, to show progress towards regional extirpation of orange hawkweed in the Australian Alps.},

In absence of relevant data and contexts for Australian quarantine, the report uses data from New Zealand on inspections and detections. It introduces some common controlcharting techniques from manufacturing and veterinary epidemiology. It concludes that control charts are particularly well suited to visualising moderate to large volumes of time-based data such as would be expected in container inspection systems, and to detecting ‘unusual’ or ‘aberrant’ trends. Their utility for detecting the occurrence (in space) of an invasive species is more limited. For very low probability events, (eg. exotic disease outbreak) monitoring ‘time between outbreaks’ is a potentially more useful quantity, although the report shows that the statistical power (ability to correctly identify real ‘shifts’ in the mean time between events) of current charting techniques is relatively low. {\textbackslash}par The report provides examples and makes suggestions regarding how these tools might be tested more effectively.},

We find that BMT can be justified, but only in cases where the FMD entry probability is high or the cost of BMT is low.

  abstract = {This report is submitted as the FINAL Report for ACERA Project 0906, Determining necessary survey effort to detect invasive weeds in native vegetation communities. {\textbackslash}par In Australia and internationally, the impact of invasive weeds on native ecosystems and agricultural productivity is undeniably significant. It is now accepted that early detection of invasive weeds is essential for their effective management. Designing monitoring and survey processes aimed at detecting new incursions of invasive weeds requires an understanding of the detectability of the targeted weed species. To date, weed detectability has been investigated mainly in the context of determining the interval between surveys. Here, we discuss weed detection in the context of designing optimal surveillance strategies. {\textbackslash}par This project aims to develop a collaboration between the Australian Centre of Excellence in Risk Analysis, Applied Environmental Decision Analysis and Northern Australian Quarantine Strategy practitioners aimed at incorporating new developments in optimal surveillance into NAQS activities and investigating options for addressing the uncertainty attributed to imperfect detectability where it exists. This report represents the first stage in the development of optimal survey methods under NAQS. Here we provide a brief review of issues associated with the design of optimal survey strategies, focussing on the problem of imperfect detectability. We review methods for data collection and estimation of detectability rates and provide two case studies that detail data collection and state-of-the-art modelling of detection rates for grassland species. Models of detection time are presented for two highly invasive Nassella species, as is a new trait-based model of plant detection time that may be used to provide estimates of detectability where no species-specific detection model exists. We provide recommendations for the design of an optimal surveillance strategy under the NAQS and conclude with some general comments about surveillance and imperfect detection in Australian Government biosecurity programs.},

  abstract = {The main aim of biosecurity response to an incursion is to achieve pest- or disease-free status as quickly as possible. One of the critical initial response activities involves tracing known movements (trace events) to and from an infected or infested property (IP) that could spread the pest or pathogen. During an incursion response, managers prioritize individual trace events, allocating surveillance resources to follow-up trace events in order of priority. Prioritizing trace events is difficult and typically subjective. We present a simulation model where different dispersal mechanisms spread a pest or pathogen between areas. We use model outputs to test different search strategies, using citrus canker (caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas citri) as a case study. Model scenarios are based on an outbreak of citrus canker that occurred in Emerald, Queensland, in 2004. {\textbackslash}par Model parameters were extracted from published scientific reports and elicited from experts. We used model outputs to assess four search strategies to determine how best to monitor citrus canker spread. Parameters governing disease detectability and host susceptibility were varied in a sensitivity analysis. {\textbackslash}par Flexible simulation software was implemented in program R. Whilst the simulator can be parameterised for many outbreak situations, no general rules can be established using the results of this study on citrus canker for tracing other pests or diseases: the simulator should be used on a case-by-case basis. {\textbackslash}par In all simulation scenarios, the “adaptive radius” rule performed best, whereby a circular search area was placed around the IP where the disease outbreak was first detected, with a radius proportional to the estimated number of months the property was infected. Importantly, none of the search rules tested detected all IPs without completely searching all properties with susceptible hosts in the region. {\textbackslash}par We identify a simple rule of thumb for searching during a citrus canker outbreak that is robust to uncertainty. No general rules can be established using the results of this study for tracing other pests or pathogens. The model has created a framework that may be used to explore other contexts and disease dynamics, leading perhaps to more general rules for disease outbreak management.},

  abstract = {Rapid advances are occurring in the field of point-of-care (POC) tests for infectious diseases, some of which are expected to be adopted as an aid in diagnosis of emergency animal diseases (EADs). It is not possible to predict which technologies will become available commercially but future POC tests are expected to be based on improved antigen detection systems with greater analytical sensitivity and/or replacement of existing antigen-based tests by tests based on nucleic acid detection, with or without amplification. These tests will cover multiple pathogens and/or multiple characteristics of pathogens. Tests will likely require minimal operator training to perform (sample-to-answer systems). {\textbackslash}par Prompt diagnosis of EADs minimises their economic and public health effects. POC tests can reduce the time required to make a diagnosis of these diseases. A decision by public sector agencies to use POC tests as an aid in managing EADs depends on the purpose of testing, including the stage of the outbreak and response, whether the benefits outweigh the costs of test and equipment deployment, and whether they offer advantages over existing protocols for disease management based on clinical suspicion and submission of samples to a laboratory. Suitable validated POC tests, once available, supported by appropriate quality management systems, could be deployed advantageously for a number of EADs in Australia if they meet one or more of these criteria. {\textbackslash}par As with all diagnostic tests there are risks that false positive or negative results will be generated and released. These risks will need to be anticipated and managed, and become more important if farmers have access to tests capable of detecting agents causing economically important EADs. Background information on new tests and technologies is provided as are examples of how new POC tests could be applied for several EADs including highly pathogenic avian influenza and foot-and-mouth disease. {\textbackslash}par The purpose of this report is to review the use of new technologies for rapid, field-based testing in the early detection of major emergency animal diseases.},
