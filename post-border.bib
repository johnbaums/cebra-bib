  abstract = {A wide range of tools and methodologies that are available to prove the pest or disease status of a country or region was reviewed in ACERA 1004. The review highlighted the set of tools that could be used to achieve or maintain market access. Most were used for ‘proof of freedom’ claims and were classified as relating to either survey design or to scenario-tree modelling, however, not all of these have been developed into readily applicable tools that could be easily and accurately applied by biosecurity managers with limited prior knowledge of the methodology. In this document we have detailed three survey design tools that have been developed from accepted statistical formulae and are well accepted in animal-disease surveillance: FreeCalc; EpiTools; and Survey Toolbox. We recommend that EpiTools be chosen for undertaking survey design and analysis. {\textbackslash}textbackslashpar After additional investigation into scenario tree modeling (including Bayesian Belief Networks) and associated generic software, the authors deem that this method requires too much prior knowledge and is not sufficiently clear that biosecurity managers or scientific staff could be reasonably expected to use and master it quickly. It appears unlikely that a tool will ever be developed that can effectively replace the amount of training that would be required to master scenariotree modeling. If scenario-tree modeling were required to make a proof-of-freedom claim, then it would be advisable to employ an expert who has had training in the use of this methodology, to undertake the analysis.},

  abstract = {This report presents a technical development. This development is important because it simplifies some recent advances in scenario tree techniques that are being used increasingly, especially in animal disease management, to substantiate claims of disease freedom. Scenario trees are a new and popular method by which surveillance systems can be evaluated. One of their limitations is that for relatively complicated systems, such as surveillance systems for animal diseases that use multiple sources of information, the scenario trees can become large and complex. This report demonstrates how to simplify large scenario trees by ‘pruning’ redundant branches. It also shows that in many situations, scenario trees can be presented as Bayesian networks, thereby taking advantage of a considerable body of knowledge, software and expertise for building and testing systems that support claims of disease freedom.},
